== AGENT
Aarhus University Engineering, in collaboration with Tampere University and the Finnish Environment Institute
== GOAL
They wanted to demonstrate the advantages of using modern neural networks to analyse images such that the machine could automatically detect people 
and objects in a variety of scenes and even distinguish photographers on the basis of characteristics in the image - faster than any manual reviewing
process.
== DATA
160,000 photographs from Finnish Winter, Continuation, and Lapland Wars captured in 1939-1945
== METHODS
Using four object detectors, SSD, YOLOv3, RetinaNet and Mask R-CNN, to combine results for a more accurate object detection. They could detect people, airplanes, boats, trains, cars, bicycles, skis, dogs, horses, chairs, and ties.
== RESULTS
The obtained results will be used to help historians, other researchers, and professionals using historical photo archives in their work to analyze and compare the works of specific photographers.
== ISSUES
Some photographers have very distinct and easily recognisable characteristics, while others are more difficult for the AI to recognise.
== SCORE
4
== COMMENTS
It was a intresting read and the IEEE report had really great detail.
