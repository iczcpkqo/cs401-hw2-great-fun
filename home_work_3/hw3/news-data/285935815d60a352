== AGENT

US Department of Homeland Security 

== GOAL

Face recognition with face masks 

== DATA

Images of people faces taken without face masks

== METHODS

Supervised Learning

== RESULTS

Faces were recognised without a face mask but with a face mask the face is either not recognised the face or incorrectly recognised

== ISSUES

In normal circumstances there is the ethical issue of the department storing peoples data as this allows their face to be recognised.
Issue now face masks cover half the face and the face cannot be detected

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

The use of face masks with the current situation causes the AI to either not recognise the face or incorrectly recognise the face. This is a very interesting problem
