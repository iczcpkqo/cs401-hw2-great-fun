== AGENT

University of Minnesota

== GOAL

develope a system that can estimate teh poses of macaque monkeys

== DATA

62 machine vision cameras surronding a monkey enclosure. These images were then used to create a 3-D data augmentational reconstruction of the images

== METHODS

robust view-invariant deep neural network

== RESULTS

They outperformed some of the commercially available marker based motion capture systems

== ISSUES

What issues do you see with the work (if any)? Technical problem,
ethical issues, honesty in reporting the results, etc.

== SCORE

2

== COMMENTS

They claim studying the behavior of monkeys helps them understand the behavior of humans. I dont see it. If we want to understand humans why dont we just study humans. Put cameras all over the place like china, and study away.
