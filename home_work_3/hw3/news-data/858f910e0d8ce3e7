AGENT OpenAI
GOAL OpenAI wanted to develop a team of five neural networks to compete against professional players in the popular online game Dota 2.
DATA There are many playable characters within the game and it used LSTM data for each of them.
METHODS It used reinforcement learning simulating 180 years of gameplay a day. Games last an average of 45 minutes, so the bot was running multiple games at once at a higher speed than usual.
RESULTS OpenAI was brought in to play against one of the best teams that play Dota 2 professionally during one of their tournaments. While not as successful as the original OpenAI 1v1 Dota bot, they performed quite well on the stage and it is still a great advancement as the 5v5 format is much more complicated than the 1v1 format.
COMMENTS OpenAI 5 shows great advancements to machine learning. Previously bots to play games like Chess and Go where made. However, Dota 2 and other online games are much more complex when it comes to choices, as there is many more moves you can make at any given moment.
