University of California San Diego School of Medicine

== GOAL
Using artificial intelligent technologies to analyze natural language patterns to discern degrees of loneliness in older adults.

== DATA
The use of words in particular patterns instead of the dictionary-based approach.

== METHODS
The use of natural language processing (NLP) that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. It makes it possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important.

== RESULTS
In a study on 80 independent senior living residents, a base 20 questions were used to determine there loneliness, they were also interviewed and recorded. Taking keywords, categories, sentiment, emotion and syntax the AI could predict loneliness with 94% percision when compared to the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Lonely people tend to take longer to respond and showed greter sadness when asked direct questions about loneliness.

== ISSUES
Using a broad spectrum for both men and women may throw up problems as shown in testing men used more fearful and joyful words when compared to women, possibly suggesting more extremes in emotion. The key atribute being looked for may point out people who are just acting themeselves and may be interpreted as them needing help.

== SCORE
7

== COMMENTS
I think this is very interesting as it affects a great deal of people especially in these times people are spending more time then ever in seclusion. I may have had more questions to ask to just obtain more data, it may just flesh out the information pool, I may have split the research between men and women due to the tendencies of each group.
