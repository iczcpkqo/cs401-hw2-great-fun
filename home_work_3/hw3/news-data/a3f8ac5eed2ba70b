== AGENT

Researchers at MITâ€™s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory

== GOAL

Build a system that can automatically decipher a lost language, 
without needing advanced knowledge of its relation to other languages

== DATA
	
words from the languages
 

== METHODS

They developed a decipherment algorithm that can handle the vast space of possible transformations
and the scarcity of a guiding signal in the input.
The algorithm learns to embed language sounds into a multidimensional space where differences in
pronunciation are reflected in the distance between corresponding vectors.

== RESULTS
The proposed algorithm can assess the proximity between two languages;
in fact, when tested on known languages,
it can even accurately identify language families.

== ISSUES
none

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

I find this interesting, the potential to translate old lost languages and learn about our history as a species.
