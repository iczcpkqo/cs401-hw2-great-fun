== AGENT

Penn State University and Houston Methodist

== GOAL

Analyse facial movements when speaking to detect stroke using a smartphone camera

== DATA

The data was collected by taking videos of 80 Houston Methodist patients who had symptoms of stroke in which they prefomred speach tests

== METHODS

The application uses computational facial motion analysis and natural language processing to spot defects in the face such as a sagging muscles which can indicate signs of stroke

== RESULTS

79% accuracy in detecing stroke which is on par with CT scans

== ISSUES

no issues

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

This is a very interesting application of machine learning. Not only can a computer anaylse the nuance of someones face but also take that information and compute wether that person has symptoms of stroke.
