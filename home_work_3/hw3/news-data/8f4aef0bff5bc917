== GOAL

New deep learning models: Fewer neurons, more intelligence

== DATA

The part of data accessable was generated by active test runs and is available for dowload from their git repo. Full dataset is available on request. The dataset has 29 rows and 2 columns. Each row has 265 by 541 matrix for column 0 and 1D vector of length 265 for column 1. Data was obtained by collecting many hours of traffic videos of human driving in greater Boston.

== METHODS

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), gated RNNs such as Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), Supervised learning

== RESULTS

It copes much better with noisy input. The new approach reduces the size of the networks by two orders of magnitude.

== ISSUES

No issues, as AI is enhanced by using the principles of computation in biological nervous systems.

== SCORE

7, as the new model shows better performance than other deep learning models.

== COMMENTS

The article seemed fair as the research team have indeed published a paper with links to datasets and code. AI is getting better at adapting and processing huge data with new methods.
