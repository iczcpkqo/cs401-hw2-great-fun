== AGENT

Hugo Caselles-Dupr√©, Pierre Fautrel and Gauthier Vernier.

== GOAL

To try and create artificial creativity with AI generated portraits.

== DATA

15,000 portraits painted between the 14th century to the 20th

== METHODS

Generative adversarial network

== RESULTS

They got back a very human link drawing that eventually sold for 400000 dollars

== ISSUES

They found it very hard in this genre of painting because humans are highly attuned to the curves and complexities of a face in a way that a machine cannot be.

== SCORE

5

== COMMENTS

Proves artifical creativity is possible. But also a bit of a setback for the art community as it takes away the expression from art.
