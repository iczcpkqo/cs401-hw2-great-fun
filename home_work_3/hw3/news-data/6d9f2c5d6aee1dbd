== AGENT

Ivan Smirnov,
Leading Research Fellow of the Laboratory of Computational Social Sciences at the Institute of Education of HSE University

== GOAL

A computer model that can distinguish high academic achievers from lower ones based on their social media posts

== DATA
Posts from publicly viewable VK pages were used as a training sample:
The prediction model uses a mathematical textual analysis that registers users' vocabulary 
(its range and the semantic fields from which concepts are taken),
characters and symbols, post length, and word length.
Every word has its own rating (a kind of IQ).

== METHODS

Linear regression model

== RESULTS

Smirnov calculated the coefficients for all 2.5 million words of the vector model and made them available for further study.
Even words that are rarely found in a training dataset can predict academic performance.

== ISSUES

Breach of privacy perhaps

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS
Impressive, I didn't think it was possible to do someething this complex with regression models.
