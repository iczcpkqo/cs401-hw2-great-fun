== GOAL



Reconstruct human thoughts from brain waves in real time



== DATA



Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings where the subject was asked to look at a set of images



== METHODS



By analyzing brain activity, the system reconstructed the images seen by the person using a Brain-Computer 
Interface (BCI) operation algorithm.



== RESULTS



The system generated images that could be easily categorized in 90 percent of cases.



== ISSUES



A person's mood, comfort or other stimuli may affect the EEG scan.

== SCORE



9



== COMMENTS



Very interesting research that could help people across a wide range of disabilities.
