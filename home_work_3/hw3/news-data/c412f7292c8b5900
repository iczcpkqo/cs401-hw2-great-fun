== COMMENTS

The article explained thoroughly the misconception regarding the technological unemployment but gave no details about the methods and algorithms that are being used to increase efficiency
and productivity.This press article is general in the sense that it covers the topic related to ML in a broader sense. The article could have been more informative if the writer would 
have dived a bit deeper in the processes used by automation firms and the jobs that will be more susceptible to extinction.
