== AGENT

Los Alamos National Laboratory

== GOAL

Autonomous, Low cost, Fast Leak Detection System (ALFaLDS) to detect, locate and quantify gas leaks in gas field infrastructure.  

== DATA

Los Alamos National Laboratory's high resolution plume dispersion models and on-site controlled releases.

== METHODS

Not mentioned in article.

== RESULTS

ALFaLDS locates and quanifies leaks precisely and could reduce methane emissions by 90% if deployed in industry.

== ISSUES

Vague description given of training methods (maybe to make article more accessible to non technical readers).
No quantifiable results offered or comparisons to other systems or benchmarks.

== SCORE

4

== COMMENTS

It's cool that they were able to locate the source of a gas leak based on atmospheric wind models.
It's also interesting how they initially trained the neural network on simulated data from models.
However, as mentioned in the 'ISSUES' above, the reporting fails to give details of specific training 
methods or frame results in context of previous work or alternate systems.
