In order to craft this solution the system was given the solution of what the solved cube looked like along with a list of all possible configurations of the rubix cube, and the starting configuration of the scrambled cube. From its first move the cube navigates through the search tree containing each configuration and determines whether the move that is made is closer to the solution than the previous state. This determination decides whether the machine is rewarded for the move or not.
