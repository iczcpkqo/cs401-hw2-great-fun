== AGENT

Los Alamos National Laboratory

== GOAL
Develop a natural-gas leak-detection tool that uses sensors and machine learning to locate leak points at oil and gas fields, promising new automatic, affordable sampling across vast natural gas infrastructure.

== DATA

The code is trained using Los Alamos National Laboratory's high resolution plume dispersion models and the training is finessed on-site by controlled releases.

== METHODS

They used a neural network that detects, locates and quantifies a natural gas leak based on real-time methane and ethane (in natural gas) and atmospheric wind measurements. This would be considered supervised learning.

== RESULTS

Test results using blind releases at an oil and gas well-pad facility at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado, demonstrated that the ALFaLDS locates the engineered methane leaks precisely and quantifies their size.
ALFaLDS's success in locating and quantifying fugitive methane leaks at natural gas facilities could lead to a 90 percent reduction in methane emissions if implemented by the industry

== ISSUES

The report referenced an academic paper that was peer reviewed. The device was trained and tested using different data sets from different locations with promising results. 

== SCORE
6

== COMMENTS

I think this is a simple device that could save lives. It is easily installed and shows good results.
