GOAL
 A system that uses neural networks that identifies faces with 97.35% accuracy.
DATA
Trained on the largest facial dataset to-date, an identity labeled dataset of four million facial images belonging to more than 4,000 identities.
METHODS
In modern face recognition, the conventional pipeline consists of four stages: detect => align => represent => classify. Facebook revisited both the alignment step and the representation step by employing explicit 3D face modeling in order to apply a piecewise affine transformation, and derive a face representation from a nine-layer deep neural network. This deep network involves more than 120 million parameters using several locally connected layers without weight sharing, rather than the standard convolutional layers
RESULTS
The results are an improvement of more than 27% over previous systems and rivals human performance.
COMMENTS
This is a remarkable accomplishment, and hopefully in the near future it will be able to be used with accuracy by the police to identify criminals, etc.
