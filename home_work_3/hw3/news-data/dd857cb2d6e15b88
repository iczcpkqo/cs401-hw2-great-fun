== AGENT

Researchers from Penn State University and Houston Methodist Hospital

== GOAL

Use a smartphone camera to quickly gauge facial movements for sign of a stroke.

== DATA

Relies on computational facial motion analysis and natural language processing to spot sagging muscles, 
slurred speech or other stroke-like symptoms.:
To build and train it, the researchers used an iPhone to record 80 Houston Methodist patients who were 
experiencing stroke symptoms as they performed a speech test.

== METHODS

Not specified

== RESULTS
The machine learning model performed with 79% accuracy when tested again on that dataset,
which the researchers said is roughly on par with emergency room diagnoses using CT scans.


== ISSUES

No issues

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

It seems like a useful tool that could speed up the diagnosis process which will favour patients.
