GOAL

To start with develop a program that can learn to play any game and then subsequently learn how to beat any other program or human

DATA

The learning algrothim needs only the rules on how the game is played and can then teach itself the rules

METHODS

Alpha go uses many diffrent method to work this includes using Monte Carlo Tree Search and various other methods.
It calcuilates based on previous games what the best course of action could be for a given move and can determine from this information what to do next
It also uses machine elarning to predict what move an aponent would make based on previous moves. It can then learn sure fire stragies to defeating most players and machines

RESULTS

Alpha Zero within 24hours  taught itself how to playe chess but aslo was able to beat the current worlds best chess playing program. 
It has also been generalised so that it can do this with most other games

COMMENTS

AlphaZero and DeepMind are to really intersting applications for Machine learning are the primary use cases of it so far
