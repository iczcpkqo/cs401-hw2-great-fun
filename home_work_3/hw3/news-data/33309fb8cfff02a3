== GOAL


Help blind people navigate streets, recognise objects and negotiate traffic lights and crossings.


== DATA


The data is gathered through cameras that map the environs and send the data to the cloud.


== METHODS


Reinforcement Learning. The real time data is processed and information output is made through speech.


== RESULTS


No results on the report.


== ISSUES


I believe it’s too risky to count entirely on a device to replace human discernment to guide you through the streets.


== SCORE


3


== COMMENTS


The report was too brief and lacking details. The purpose of the project is spectacular but errors/delay on the data or processing can be fatal.
