== GOAL


Use AI to learn the biological properties of the protein a DNA encodes in order to design lab-engineered proteins drugs quicker and more efficiently. 


== DATA


They get the data by tests run on proteins they make with information like how stable they are or how much it reacts to other substances.


== METHODS


They are using Supervised Learning.  Training a machine to predict how the protein’s properties will correspond to certain DNA.


== RESULTS


I didn’t get any numbers from the report but at the moment they had just designed a pill for inflammatory bowel disease which can survive digestive enzymes and the acidic environment found in the stomach (only injections were efficient so far). 


== ISSUES


They will conduct tests on animals for this pill first. Personally, I don’t think it’s ethical or will be biologically efficient. 


== SCORE


8


== COMMENTS


It is certainly generating new data for the Pharma industry and similar methods were used before.
The report was good enough but could have provided some data.
