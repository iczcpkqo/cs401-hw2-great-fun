== AGENT

iMolecule group at Skoltech Center for Computational and Data-Intensive Science and Engineering

== GOAL

Find optimal spots for drug molecules to attach to proteins using deep learning and computer Vision

== DATA

The data was atomic structures of protein-ligard complexes that contain less than four protein chains and the sequence identity threshold of 90% from a protein data bank

== METHODS

A Neural network along with mean shift clustering algorithm, the density-based clustering algorithm and the agglomerative hierachical clustering algorithm

== RESULTS

The result is a system called BiteNet which can analyze 1000 protein structures in 1.5 minutes and find optimal spots for drug molecules to attach

== ISSUES

Due to the proteins being Experimentally determinded protein structures, they often contain detergent and buffer molecules that reveal electron density. This should not be confused with actual binding stites.
