== AGENT
Google's DeepMind

== GOAL
Develop an AI that is capable of mimicing the thinking process of a 
human mind, and use it for a variety of jobs, such as diagnosing medical
conditions.

== DATA
One example of data DeepMind is using images of eye scans and patient
data. It has access to to over 1 million eye scans, courtersy of an eye 
hospital in London.

== METHODS
From the eye data it has been given, the DeepMind AI has been training 
itself to identify the onset of eye conditions from the scans and the
corresponding patient data.

== RESULTS
Due to it being an ongoing and in depth study, the results are not yet 
finalised, however many aspects of DeepMind are showing promsing strides.
DeepMind has been gone from playing games like chess, to simple videogames 
like pac man and even further to playing very complex games such as Dota.

== ISSUES
DeepMind is showing great potential but is still a long way off its goal,
due to the extent of the research being carried out, and safety being the 
ultimate priority.

== SCORE
7
== COMMENTS
All things considered, DeepMind is a work in progress and paving the way to 
AI's replacing and improving jobs carried out by humans. A very exciting
prospect and with Google at the helm, great things can be expected.
