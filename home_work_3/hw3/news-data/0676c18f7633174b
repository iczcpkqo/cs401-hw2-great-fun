AGENT

Keiwan Donyagard. He is an independent software developer.

GOAL

The main goal of this project is to make easy to understand how machine learning works, using an amusing simulator, where
the user can use joints, bones and muscles to make a creature that evolves for generations.

DATA

The only data required is about the figure that the user designs to start the simulation, and the data obtained from
previous generations.

METHODS

To improve how the figure moves, the simulator uses genetic algorithm and neural networks.

RESULTS

The output of this project is a very easy to use simulator that can be installed both in a mobile phone as in a computer.

COMMENTS

While it is true that the simulator doesn't achieve an important goal, it shows in a very simple way how machine learning
works. Thanks to that, the simulator is a good didactic tool to use with beginners.
