== GOAL

Uses AI to find waldo in a where's Waldo book

== DATA

Googleâ€™s AutoML Vision service has been trained on 62 distinct Waldo heads and 45 Waldo heads plus bodys.

== METHODS

Supervised image classification, Deep learning

== RESULTS

Can locate waldo as fast as 4.45 secs

== ISSUES

Where's waldo forever ruined, maybe more training samples could result in faster timing

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

An interesting application of AI, that caters to childhood nostalgia.
Was covered extensively by press due to its quirky nature, coverage although
not too indepth. Used Google's cloud AutoML which requires little coding 
knowledge. This project shows that AI can be achieved in smaller projects 
without major experience.
