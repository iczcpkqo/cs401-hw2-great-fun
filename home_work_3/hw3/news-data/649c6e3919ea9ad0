== GOAL

Automatic categorization of patients with CNV using ML

== DATA

They phenotyped a total of 61 baseline characteristics. All participants underwent
complete ophtalmological examinations.

== METHODS

Unsupervised

== RESULTS

The CNV score obtained based on logistic regression results showed the possibility of diagnosing 
PNV and was significantly associated with visual prognosis at 3 months after anti-VEGF treatment.

== ISSUES

Seventy-two patients were excluded due to lack of data; specifically, 53 patients lacked axial length data, 
because axial length was not routinely measured before April 2013.
The current unsupervised machine learning revealed that 46.2% of CNV belong to pachychoroid spectrum,
which was higher than the proportion described in our previous report

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

I think this is somewhat interesting as it is greatly beneficial to patients and doctors but the results were
not ground breaking.
