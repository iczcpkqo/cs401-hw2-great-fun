== AGENT
FitBit

== GOAL
To optimise to workings of the fitbit device, to improve the user's overall health, 
and  to send the same data to healthcare profesionals and insrance companies for study and benefits respectively.

== DATA
daily health stats of the user, such as calorie intake, steps, heartrate,
sleep patterns, etc.

== METHODS
the data is obtained either by the device itself or entered by the user. The fitbit will monitor bodily 
stats and movement, such as steps, calories burned and sleeping patterns, carried by out through the devices abiity to monitor 
heartrate directly from the user's pulse, and steps/speed from its built in accelerometer. Data such as calorie intake would be 
inputted directly by the user to the fitbit. The fitbit learns from the user's data and schedules for optimal performance. 

== RESULTS
Being a relatively simple model, the fitbit is very successful in aquiring data. It helps the user maintain a healthy lifestyle, as well
as well as sending the user reminders and updates, such as if the user's sleep pattern is off-track, or if they haven't exercised recently.

== ISSUES
Being a simple model without complex maxhinre learning techniques, there are no such issues with the fitbits machine learning model.

== SCORE
6

== COMMENTS
For me, the best quality of the Fitbit's model is the perks it can offer the user , health benefits aside even.
Some insurance companies now offer benefits on health insurance if the policy holder has a fitbit, allowing the company to
to give rewards based on the customer's diet and lifestyle.
