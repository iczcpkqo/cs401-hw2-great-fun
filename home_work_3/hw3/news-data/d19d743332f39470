Prof Brendan Meade's and Dr Phoebe DeVries' teams

== GOAL

This study aims at predicting the aftershocks after an earthquake (where
they are going to be).

== DATA

They used a database of over 100,000 earthquakes and aftershocks.

== METHODS

They used a supervised neural network.

== RESULTS

The article gives no quantitative information about the results. However,
Dr Elizabeth Cochran, a seismologist who did not worked on the study, 
explains that the results are not relevant yet, in that they are predicting
aftershocks in very obvious places, like around the fault.

== ISSUES

It is almost impossible to get information on all the aftershocks after an 
earthquake. To be detected, they need to happen in a zone where there is 
permanent seismometers or where seismologists has set an installation to 
record them. Therefore it is impossible to know for sure that all of them 
have been properly detected.

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

This study is exploring a new field and will hopefully soon be able to
give researchers valuable information and help to protect the populations 
from these events.
