AGENT
Self-service drinks machines where customers could freely mix their own drinks.

GOAL
Create a new flavour of drink to manufacture that is guaranteed to sell.

DATA
Hundreds of thousands of customers using the machine to customise a huge array of drink combinations.

METHODS
Machine learning

RESULTS
Cherry Sprite was found to be the drink created most at these machines and so they manuactured it as a new flavour.

COMMENTS
I think the AI drink machines will be a great way to get people to interact more with their brand if they go forward with their plans.
