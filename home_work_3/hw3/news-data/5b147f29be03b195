== GOAL

Creating an Artificial Intelligence Based Interactive Movie - AGENCE

== DATA

Movie Based Data (Script, Characters, Game Rules and Guidelines), User/Viewer Input

== METHOD

Reinforcement Learning

== RESULT

Agency is VR Film/Game with AI characters which has a basic initial plot wherein an an enormous plant has taken over a tiny planet home to many three-legged aliens. The plant bears on the "forbidden fruits" which when taken a bite of, grow even bigger. Suddenly the fruit's weight flips the whole planet upside down and all the aliens drop into the space. The movie/game plan revolves all around the growing forbidden fruit and the aliens controlling desire to eat the fruit to avoid destabilising their planet. A viewer can either choose to sit back and watch as the aliens make their own decisions or they can choose to change the action sequence by eating more fruit or placing larger fruits at specific locations to balance the planet or even fight for the fruit.

== ISSUES

The game/movie has been released currently to a very small audience and though many of them seem to enjoy the interactive experience, it wouldn't really turn out to be a Blockbuster of the year! It is too relaxed to be considered a true game and the interactive nature of the movie would not call in a lot of crowd either.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

This is an interesting idea and for those interested it can certainly be a fun filled movie/game experience. The concept is beautiful! Certainly more such movies with many more AI characters and AI plots can allow the users/viewers to not only experience but also create a unique storyline. What's even better is that one can choose to watch a new story every single time though they watching the same movie/game. It is certainly confusing to choose the right verb for the Movie/Game but it sure is at the least a one time must experience for all!
