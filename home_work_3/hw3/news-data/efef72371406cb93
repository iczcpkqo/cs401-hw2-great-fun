GOAL

Evaluate risk of not-yet-evaluated facilities failing to meet health and safety constraints.

DATA

Results of past inspections by the U.S. Envrionmental Protection Agency.

METHODS

The researchers deployed a series of models to predict the likelihood of failing an inspection, based on facility characteristics, such as location, industry and inspection history.

RESULTS

Under the scenario with the fewest constraints, the researchers predicted catching up to seven times the number of violations compared to the status quo. When they accounted for more constraints, the number of violations detected was still double the status quo.

COMMENTS

Constraints related spcifically to the Clean Water Act.
