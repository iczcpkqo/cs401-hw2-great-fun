AGENT
The app interface

GOAL
Keep users engaged by taking note of what and who they look at most and ordering their feed accordingly.
Remove offensive and unsocial comments from the app without relying on someone repoting it.

DATA
Users interactions with the app.
Previous reported comments or photos and the Community Guidelines.

METHODS
Machine learning.

RESULTS
After some trial and error time, users' feeds were ordered according to who they responded to and looked at the most, which increased user engagement.

COMMENTS
The removal of comments, while good in theory, has the possibility of removing content that is not actually offensive or violating any guidelines.
