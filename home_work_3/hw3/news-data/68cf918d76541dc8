== AGENT

Microsoft

== GOAL

Using AI to combat plastic pollution in the oceans. Building a model to identify collected waste and distinguish it from natural materials such as sticks and leaves.

== DATA

A dataset of 30,000 images collected by "Plastic Free Oceans" was used. Bounding boxes were created for the images, distinguishing what was plastic and what was not.

== METHODS

There is not much information on the specific methods used to process the dataset, other than that a machine learning model was used.

== RESULTS

Initially the non-profit, The Ocean Cleanup, labelled images manually in a process that was extremely time-consuming. The Ocean Cleanup now has the resources from this machine learning model which greatly accelerates their technical progress and puts them in a position to scale up drastically.

== ISSUES

I don't see any real issues with the work.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

This project was a good use of Microsoft's massive resources. There was not much information in the article about the accuracy of the model.
