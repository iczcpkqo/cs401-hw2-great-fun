== AGENT

IBM Chef Watson

== GOAL

Provide recipes to home chefs from user inputted ingredients

== DATA

Chef Watson was fed 30000 recipes from Bon Appetit’s archives and also has the ability to learn the science of complementary flavour compounds

== METHODS

Chef Watsons’ algorithm refines its recommendations over the course of its life through user input

== RESULTS

There is no right/wrong result for this system. 

== ISSUES

This system is fairly impractical, unnecessary and requires a decent amount of human input such as ingredients, type of desired dish (soup, burger, etc), and also category of dish (Chinese, European, easy)

== SCORE

2

== COMMENTS

IBMs Chef Watson is an interesting premise and could lead to the worlds first fully AI chefs, however at the current stage it’s impractical and not much better than a cookbook.
