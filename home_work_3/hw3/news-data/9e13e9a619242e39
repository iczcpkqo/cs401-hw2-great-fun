== AGENT
Facebook, Face.com
== GOAL
To create a system capable of identifying human faces with the accuracy of a human.
== DATA
Trained by 4 million photos of people uploaded to Facebook.
== METHODS
3D models of faces are constructed, and then passed to a neural network trained on a massive database of images. Deep Learning is used.
== RESULTS
DeepFace recognizes faces with an accuracy of 97.35% ± 0.25%, compared to the average human accuracy of  97.53%. Meaning that it almost matches the accuracy of humans, and it sometimes greater than the accuracy of humans.
== ISSUES
Many reactions to DeepFace have criticized it, calling it “creepy”. Due to data privacy concerns, many European governments required Facebook to remove facial recognition technology from it’s product.
== SCORE
6
== COMMENTS
The media seemed to cover this quite accurately. This system took the record for highest degree of accuracy in facial recognition. Previously, the FBI held this record, with a system that could recognize faces with an 85% degree of accuracy.
