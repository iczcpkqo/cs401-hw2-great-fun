== GOAL

Financial technology companies strive to take advantage of their technology 
in order to innovate and improve activities in finance. The objective of the
research paper is to develop Deep Reinforcement Learning solutions for 
algorithmic trading, more specifically, in the stock markets. 

== DATA

The team gathered eight years of real-life stock market data from 30 
different companies/instruments from diverse sectors, regions and 
liquidities to prevent bias and present the agent with multiple patterns. 
The training set consisted of data from 01/01/2012 to 31/12/2017 and the 
test set's dates ranged from 01/01/2018 to 31/12/2019.

== METHODS

In this situation, the reinforcement learning environment is the entire 
complex trading world. The agent must observe multiple factors, such as 
current market prices, volume of shares being exchanged, exchange rates and
even news information gathered from multiple sources (e.g. newspapers, 
social media). At any point, the agent has three options: buy, sell or hold,
and its objective is to increase profit with minimal risk (this is the 
reward/punishment system in this environment).

== RESULTS

The algorithm's trading strategy achieved promising results, but the 
research team did state in the conclusion that believed that they need to 
test the model with more stock market data, and perhaps switch to a 
different market, for example, foreign exchange. They also wish to test the 
AI's performance during an extraordinary event, such as the 2008 financial 
crisis.


== ISSUES

An issue with this type of model, which was also hightlighted by the
research team, that in an extreme scenario, it is unpredictable to imagine
the consequences a trader could suffer if they followed this mode of
prediction technology. It may seem irresponsible to trust the global 
economy's in the hands of AI if this form of algorithmic trading becomes
universal.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

I do think this use of machine learning will be commonly used in financial
institutions all over the world, and there will be a race for companies to
build (or purchase) the most successful method and solutions. It will also
be interesting to see if these companies will rely heavily on an AI's
prediction, or they will combine these trading forecasts with human
intuition.
