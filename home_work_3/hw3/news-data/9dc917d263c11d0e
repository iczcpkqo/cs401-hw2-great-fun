== AGENT
OpenAI

== GOAL
Create an autoregressive language model that can predict the next word to be written, and thus write for itself

== DATA
"The dataset of 300 billion tokens of text is used to generate training examples for the model" 

== METHODS
Trained from unsupervised training data

== RESULTS
A predictive text based system that is capable of intelligently writing and conversing. 

== ISSUES
None, system is only  capable of 'guessing' at what to say next. no actual higher level intelligence

== SCORE
8. Super interesting

== COMMENTS
Highly interesting system that could revolutionise how we interact with robotics in the future.
