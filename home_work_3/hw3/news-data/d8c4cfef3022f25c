== GOAL

To help identify new craters on Mars that formed within the last decade

== DATA

Over 112,000 images of the Martian surface taken by the Context Camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter

== METHODS

- The program was fed over 120,000 and was designed to scan the photos for changes to Martian surface features that indicated new craters.
- Supervised learning as the program was given images and told to look for changes
- Program given 6,830 images of identified crates to teach it what a crater looks like

== RESULTS

New cluster of craters identified on Mars that formeed within the last decade

== ISSUES

- AI can't do skilled analysis that a scientist can
- The photos taken by the Context Camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter are low resolution and cover 100s of KMs at a time which could cause problems

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

- I found this article interesting
- I think using AI to help scientists identify new craters on Mars is a good idea and wouldn't do it using any other methods
- I thought the reporting was good and they showed pictures and mentioned thigs said by some of the scientists
- I think it was an interesting way of using existing photos of the Martian surface to help and find differences faster in new photos and study them
