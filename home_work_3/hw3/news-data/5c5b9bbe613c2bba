== AGENT

A team of researchers from Stanford, MIT, and the Toyota Research Institute

== GOAL

use AI trained on data generated from these machines to predict the performance of lithium-ion 
batteries over the lifetime of the cells before their performance had started to slip

== DATA
Data type unavailable:
Data was aquired at Stanford Universityâ€™s Precourt Institute for Energy, 
there are a half dozen refrigerator-sized cabinets designed to kill batteries as fast as they can.
Each holds around 100 lithium-ion cells secured in trays that can charge and discharge the batteries dozens of times per day. 
Energy is dumped in and out of these cells as fast as possible to generate reams of performance data that will teach artificial
intelligence how to build a better battery.

== METHODS

Unsupervised

== RESULTS

AI could predict lifetime performance after only hours of data collection, previously this would take months.

== ISSUES

No issues, maybe wasting batteries & electricity

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

I found it interesting how counter-intuitive their approach seemed. Damaging batteries by stressing them severly, to obtain data and optimise the testing process.
