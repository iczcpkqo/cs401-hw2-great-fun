GOAL 

Solving a Rubik's Cube without human teaching or intervention.

DATA 

No pre-existing data was used, the algorithm learned the game by itself.

METHODS 

They used Autodidactic Iteration, a method of using positive reinforcement learning to teach an AI to solve a Rubik’s cube without previous knowledge of the puzzle.

RESULTS 

With enough training, the AI was able to solve in a median solve length (amount of moves) within 30 moves, which closely emulates what a human can do. This was above the expectations of the 

COMMENTS 

It is very interesting that the evolutionary algorithm can have the potential to learn how to solve a puzzle such as a Rubik’s Cube without any previous knowledge of the puzzle and how to solve it.
