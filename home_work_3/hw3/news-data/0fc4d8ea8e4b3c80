AGENT

The main developer of this project was David Ferrucci, who was working for IBM.

GOAL

The main goal of this project, was to make a computer system capable of processing natural language questions fast 
enough to win at the american Quiz show Jeopardy!

DATA

To find the correct answer, the computer system analyze and process a huge amount of data, using a technology called DeppQA.

METHODS

To process the information, the computer system uses tools based on optimizations of deep Content Analysis, Natural Language 
Processing, Information Retrieval, Machine Learning and Atificial Intelligence.

RESULTS

The result of this project is a machine capable to compete against players who had already appeared in the TV show

COMMENTS

This machine is the result of decades of experience and research, and it's interesting how it combines different technologies
to finally achieve the goal.
