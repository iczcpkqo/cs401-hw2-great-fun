GOAL

Using Machine Learning to monitor and run data centres and recove when there are failures

DATA

The program takes data from various data sources in the data centre such as tempeture, power supply and machine status 

METHODS

The program uses basic algorthims to solev samller problem such as cooling and power supply. 
After that the machine learning functionality kicks in to find correlation between the root cause and various other sources that could potentially be causing the problem.
Based on past cases the algorthim can detrmine the best course of action weather that be contacting the admistrator, turning off machines. Or trying to problme solve the failure.

RESULTS

The application can effectivley control and manage datacentres all around the world
