AGENT

Google DeepMind's StreetLearn

GOAL

Be able to navigate from point A to point B in a city without knowing the map.

DATA

Google Street View images from cities of New York, Paris and London so far. As an input, the target location (latitude/longitude) is given.

METHODS

Location from real-world imagery, as the human eye, the program can detect vegetation, architectures and landmarks to help find its path.
Deep reinforcement learning for navigation and deep reinforcement learning for planning and mapping.

RESULTS

The agent can navigate through the different areas of city (example : Harlem and Central Park for New York) and adapt itself to other areas (Lower Manhattan in New York for example).

COMMENTS

The idea is to extend this method to entirely new cities.
