AGENT

Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers 

GOAL

Create a model for determining if a news source is biased or inaccurate.

DATA

150 news articles from a site. Data from MediaBias/FactCheck

METHODS

Used an algorithm called a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and used the SVM classifier to classify websites similar to MediaBias/FactCheck. Checking previous articles and linguistic features including language complexity and structure were used to determine bias and accuracy.

RESULTS

The system was 65% accurate at detecting how accurate a news outlet was using a 3 point scale (highly accurate, medium or low), and roughly 70 % accurate in detecting if it is politically left-leaning, right-leaning or moderate.

COMMENTS

I found this article interesting but I don't believe it has a high enough accuracy yet to be used in real world applications. 65% accuracy is too low to be calling out news outlets as on average you're getting a wrong result for 1 out of 3 sites.
