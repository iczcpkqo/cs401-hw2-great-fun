Bloomberg News

== GOAL

Bloomberg News uses automated technology to write articles and news reports for them. Their aim was 
to have an algorithm that can dissect a finacial report the moment it appears and immedately write a news
story accurately containing the keys facts and figures from the report. 



== DATA

What data did they use: what did it look like and how did they get it?
Editiors and writers meticulously craft several versions of a particular story or report
that includes text for different outcomes of an event or topic.  


== METHODS

What methods (algorithms, etc) did they use? Supervised? Unsupervised? RL?
They use a system called Cyborg.

== RESULTS

What were their results?
The company successfully use a system that is able to take finacial reports as an input
and to output a perfectly written article on the companys earnings. 
The company also adapted this system to set up alerts to signal anomalous bits of data, 
reporters who see the alert can determine if there is a bigger story to be written by a human
being.

== ISSUES

What issues do you see with the work (if any)? Technical problem,
ethical issues, honesty in reporting the results, etc.
A major issure with a machine generating an earnings report article is that companies can 
choose figures to create a more favourable protrayal then the numbers warrant.

== COMMENTS

Your comments on this: did you think it was interesting and why, would
you have done it differently, was the reporting in the Press
reasonable or did they get lots of stuff wrong, etc. Was the method new,
or was it interesting new data, or an interesting new way of using existing
data and methods?
I would not describe this story as interesting simply because it is an algorithm writing articles.
The system they use successfully carries out the task it was intended for, it is helpful for the
industry and allows reporters to focus on other tasks. It also means that each article written by the algorithm
is grammatically correct. The article was fair and showed both pro's and con's to using this techinology.

The English city of Rochdale employed two economics to carry out an experiment.

== GOAL

What were they trying to accomplish?
The city of Rochdale's goal is to carry out an experiment using machine learning
to judge an entire towns wellbeing based on the tweets it's inhabitants send out.
The experiment evalutes the tweets over a the period of a day and gauges the emotional state of the town


== DATA

The data used for this experiment were the tweets written by the inhabitants of this
city. Tweets can be up to 140 characters long and can include links to relevant websites 
and resources. The tweets were obtained from the inhabitants twitter social media accounts.

== METHODS

An algorithm was developed that took in thousands of tweets on a daily basis and analysed them for
words that had a postive or negative connotation associated with them. Using this data it was able 
to give real time results on the overall emotional state of the city for that particual day.

== RESULTS

As the experiment has only been running for a year the only results they have concluded 
is that Rochdale is happier on a Friday than a Monday, happier at Christmas than in January,
when the credit card bills come rolling in and permanently less happy than London.
At the beginning, it did concluded that the town was happier while it was involved in a
charity bike ride.


== ISSUES

There is always an ethical issue when analysing peoples personal data, although
people are willing giving out information about themselves, this can make them a target.
Their data can be used to predict who they would vote for in an election, how they will respond
to particular events. Analysing peoples data makes them predicatable and they can be 
easily manipulated from this.

This experiment was very interesting as the data collected was analysed in a new way.
It is also an enjoyable report to read as the content was correct and also linked
in other current studied similar to this one.

Cancer researchers 

== GOAL

What were they trying to accomplish?
Researchers were aiming to develope a system that used machine learning to
detect cancer cells from a blood test. The test would learn to detect the chemical 
changes in the DNA known as methylation patterns.

== DATA

Initially the system with fed data on methylation patterns in DNA 
from within blood samples taken from more than 2,800 patients, before 
further training the algorithm with data from 3,052 participants, 1,531 of whom had 
cancer and 1,521 of whom did not


== METHODS

The test was developed using a machine learning algorithm. The system picked up
on patterms within data and as a result classified it. The system sorted the samples into groups based on the methylation patterns. 
The system was then taught which groups reflected which type of cancer.


== RESULTS

The system designed could detect 50 types of hard to identify cancers.
The test can not only identify if somebody has cancer but can shed light on 
what type of cancer they have by identifying what type of tissue it originated from.
Across more the 50 different types of cancers, the system correctly detected that the disease was
present 44% of the time.


== ISSUES

A major issure with this is the possibility of wrongfully detecting cancer.
This system would need extensive research to be reliable in identifying cancers. 
Not detecting cancer when it is present is also a major issure as it could go untreated.

I personally think this is highly interesting because it is a universal problem,
therefore everybody benefits from there being a solution developed that helps detect it.
However, the press will always highlight this development in a possive way and may exaggerate
details. The method used in this test is very interesting

Social workers

== GOAL

Use a system that would help social workers identify the probabilty of a child
coming on to the at-risk register and how they might prevent it.


== DATA

They get vast amounts of data from a number of sources such as police records, 
housing benefit files, social services, education and the health service. 
Data includes childs attendance at school and if the family are behind on with rent. 

== METHODS

A supervised algorithm was used analysed data about a child from numerous resources
and was trained to cross-reference this information and produce a percentage
of how at risk a child was.

== RESULTS

Social service departments are using machine learning to help them indentify
child at risk in their communities. The system gives them a percentage based on information
fed to it. However this is only part of a toolbase for social workers and would
never be the only method used. 


== ISSUES

There are major ethical issues with using machine learning as part of social services
as the information is so sensitive and personal to each case. There is many problems
with the accuracy of this system if some information is not presented or it focuses
too much of on one aspect of the childs life.

== SCORE

4

== COMMENTS

This is an interesting use of machine learning however there will alway be massive ethical issues
with this and with obtaining the information needed to run this algorithm as it is the sensitive information
of children and the less information provided the less accurate the result will be.

== AGENT

Who did this machine-learning-related work (e.g., Netflix)
a student from Michigan State

== GOAL

What were they trying to accomplish?
To develope an algorithm to efficiently find wally from the books wheres wally.

== DATA

What data did they use: what did it look like and how did they get it?
He derive the method for finding Wally fastest using a data set mapping out all of 
Wally's positions across all 68 of Handford's books published since 1987.

== METHODS

What methods (algorithms, etc) did they use? Supervised? Unsupervised? RL?
The co-ordinates where plugged into a genetic algorithm
a search process that mimics the process of natural selection used in
artificial intelligence as part of machine learning.


== RESULTS

The result was a trial and error search that optimised the fastest 
route to take across the page to find Wally. The algorithm was ran for 5 minutes
and found the best solution - a path across the page that takes into account that 
Wally is never in the top left of the page, as he would be covered by the postcard, 
or in the bottom right as that's the most looked at part of the entire page, as readers 
see it first when turning the pages of the book.

== ISSUES

There is no issues with this. The problem was solved and solved effiently.


== SCORE

== COMMENTS

This was interesting because the algorithm was applied to a quirky well known 
childrens book, which made the report interesting to read about to see how machine learning
can be applied to solve a basic problem such as finding a kids character.

Who did this machine-learning-related work (e.g., Netflix)
Researchers from New York University.

== GOAL

Use machine learning to create a fake fingerprint to use as a masterkey to biometric 
scanners. 

== DATA

What data did they use: what did it look like and how did they get it?
The used a database of numerous fingerprints in order to analyse them to find 
common features.


== METHODS

What methods (algorithms, etc) did they use? Supervised? Unsupervised? RL?
They used a generative adversarial network, to artifically create new fingerprints.

== RESULTS

What were their results?
They successfully generated fake fingerprints that fooled a biometric scanner
and also allowed them to create ones that look like real finger prints to the human eye. 

== ISSUES

What issues do you see with the work (if any)? Technical problem,
ethical issues, honesty in reporting the results, etc.
There are major issues with creating fake fingerprints.
It immediately makes biometric scanners less secure as they can fooled. There is also 
and ethical issure as people fingers prints are used as the database for making these.
