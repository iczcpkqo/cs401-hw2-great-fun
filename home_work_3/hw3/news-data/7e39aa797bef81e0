AGENT

Amazon's Automated Ripeness Detection System

GOAL

To determine the quality of fruits and vegetables

DATA

The machine was fed what good and bad products look like by inputting new product variants on a daily basis. The products are photographed and made available to the machine in the shape of data. That way, the computer gradually understands the quality standards.

METHODS

Pattern Matching Algorithm

RESULTS

The machine was able to identify bad quality produce from the good one. This helped the employees to easily remove the bad ones.

COMMENTS

The system is still in development phase. It still needs more data before giving a better success rate.
