The UK's Alzheimer's Society, IBM Research and Pfizer 

== GOAL

This society is trying to use machine learning to accelerate the process of diagnosis of dementia.

== DATA

The data came from The Framingham Heart Study, an US research project that follows 5000 people.
The IA works on audio samples of the persones describing a picture.

== METHODS

The IA uses natural language processes (NLP).

== RESULTS

The tests show that the IA is able to predict the apparition of Alzheimer symptoms within the 7 years 
following the test with an accuracy of 70%.

== ISSUES

Since Alzheimer has no known treatment yet, this experiment is conducted with great ethical care.
Some people can indeed prefer not to know in advance they will be touched by this disease since 
there is nothing that can be done about it.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

The picture presented to the people taking the test is always the same. The IA looks for grammatical
mistakes and different sentence structure. If the tool is proven working, it will not give a definitive
diagnosis but will be an help for doctors.
