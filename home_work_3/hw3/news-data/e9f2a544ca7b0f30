== AGENT
DrDoctor

== GOAL
Reduce number of in person visits that doctors need to carry out to speed up wait times

== DATA
Unsupervised

== METHODS
Using data collected from hospitals, they analysed visits that could have been done remotely/not in person and attempted to generalise a model to generate future predictions. 

== RESULTS
"Dr Sivanandan said the system had "huge potential" for freeing up doctors' time" Reduces patients needing to be seen in person by about 12%

== ISSUES
Some people don't want their hospital visits to depend on them meeting a "criteria" to suit an algorithm

== SCORE
4. Mainly boring, but has useful applications

== COMMENTS
On a high level, the idea is sound, it is always useful to improve wait times and help reduce patient load, but it is also contributing to a dehumanisation of the medical services that could get out of control.
