Deep Visual-Semantic Alignments for Generating Image Descriptions https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.2306.pdf

AGENT

Andrej Karpathy Et al.

GOAL

To build a model that generates natural language descriptions of images and their regions.

DATA

Images dataset with descriptions of each image. 

METHODS

Training separate Recurrent Neural Networks to first separate objects from descriptions and then to apply those objects to the images. 

RESULTS

The results  showed that this model provides state of the art performance on image-sentence ranking experiments. Second, they described a Multimodal Recurrent Neural Network architecture that generates descriptions of visual data. Results showed that it outperforms other retrieval baselines.
