GOAL
THe goal was to develop a new machine learning system designed to evaluate not only individual articles, but entire news sources. The system is programmed to classify news sources for general accuracy and political bias.
DATA
The system was fed data from a source called Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC). This independent, non-partisan resource classifies news sources based on political bias and accuracy.
METHODS
The system was trained to classify the bias and accuracy of a source based on five features: textual, syntactic and semantic article analysis; its Wikipedia page; Twitter account; URL structure; and web traffic.
RESULTS
Researchers report it is 65 percent accurate in detecting factual accuracy and 70 percent accurate at detecting political bias, compared to similar human-checked data from MBFC.
COMMENTS
It is pretty accurate for the amount data it is trained on.
