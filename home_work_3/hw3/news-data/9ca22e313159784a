== AGENT

Texas Tech University

== GOAL

They were trying to develop a type of deep-learning algorithm known as a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can differentiate among the fMRI signals of healthy people, people with mild cognitive impairment, and people with AD.

== DATA

A public database is all that they said.

== METHODS

A type of deep-learning algorithm known as a convolutional neural network (CNN)

== RESULTS

Their results demonstrate that deep learning-based approaches can help improve diagnosis not only for AD but also for other neurological disorders.

== ISSUES

What issues do you see with the work (if any)? Technical problem,
ethical issues, honesty in reporting the results, etc.

Since it was on the news, for the general public to see, I believe they could have reported it better and made it easier for the general person to understand.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

Yes this was extremely interesting and is definitely something that I would like to look into more.  If I was doing it I would have done it for more diseases instead of just Alzheimers.  The press did a good job of reporting this, it was pretty much just a regurgitation of what the researchers said.  The method was not new, they simply used CNN's on public data.
