== GOAL

Use voice samples from people describing a picture to predict if they will get dementia/Alzheimer's disease.

== DATA

Samples used came from The Framingham Heart Study, a US research project into 5,000 people and their families 
that has been ongoing since 1948.

== METHODS

The AI model uses natural language processing to analyse short excerpts of speech taken from the Cookie Theft cognitive
test, where participants describe what they see in the picture. The AI uses grammatical errors and subtle changes to sentence
structure as indicators of cognitive decline. The methods for training this AI are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated 
that the long running nature of the sample collection allows the AI to compare its predictions against actual diagnoses.
This implies that its tarined using supervised learning techniques.

== RESULTS

System predicts onset dementia seven years earlier than human doctors with 70% accuracy.

== ISSUES

As with all AI applications in the medical field, there are potential ethical isssues that arise from false positives and false negatives.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

The data used for the development of this system has been collected only from people in the US.
There is also no guarantee that it represents different age ranges, genders and ethnicities.
