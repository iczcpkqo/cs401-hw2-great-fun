Accurately identified 98.5% of coughs from people who were confirmed to have COVID-19,
including 100% of coughs from asymptomatics (did not have symptoms but had tested positive.

Ethical issues arise regarding false positives and false negatives. If someone actually has COVID-19 but
this system tells them they don't (false negative) they could potentially infect other people.

== COMMENTS

The reporting lacks detail about the machine learnign techniques employed.
This is a cool concept and has already been used to detect other illnesses such as pneumonia.
It would be interesting to see it applied to other types of illnesses using different biometric data.
