== AGENT

Facebook

== GOAL

Detect whether two faces in unfamiliar photos are of the same person for use in Facebook's "tagging" feature to suggest friends to tag in photos

== DATA

Dataset of 4,000,000 images of faces of 4,000 people

== METHODS

3D model for rotating faces in images, so that the face is "looking" at the camera
9 layer neural network to detect similarities between the two faces

== RESULTS

DeepFace showed human level accuracy in recognising similar faces in images
DeepFace reaches an accuracy of 97.35% Â± 0.25% where human beings have 97.53%
- Sometimes better than humans

== ISSUES

Facebook's generally shady behaviour in tracking users across websites may allow Facebook to track users in images across these websites and link them back to Facebook itself.
- i.e. A photo of me in example.com would be discovered by Facebook, and would be used by Facebook to market to me.
> Facebook suspended tag suggestions in 2011 after a probe by the EU

== SCORE

5

== COMMENTS

Interesting methods to extract faces from images and position them in a standardised way, regardless of the image and orientation of face in the image
Massive increase in accuracy, at the time FBI methods only worked 80-85%
