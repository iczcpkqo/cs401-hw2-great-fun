== GOAL

Predict retinal disease progression using AI. 
More specifically, to predict cases of AMD (age related macular degeneration) 
that will develop into the more advanced exAMD (exudative AMD).

== DATA

Dataset of anonymised retinal scans from Moorfields Eye Hospital patients with exAMD
in one eye and at high risk of developing it in their other eye. Comprises 2,795 patients
across seven different hospitals with representation across genders, age and ethnicities. 

== METHODS

System consists of two deep convolutional neural networks that take high dimensional volumetric
eye scans as input. The eye scans are segmented into thirteen anatomical categories using an existing model
(previously developed by DeepMind). The segmented data is combined with the raw eye scan and used as input to
the prediction model which is trained to estimate a patients risk of conversion to exAMD in their other eye
within the next six months.

== RESULTS

Six retinal experts, each with at least ten years experience, were asked to predict if a an eye will convert to 
exAMD within the ensuing six months. 
The system performed as well as, and in some cases better than, these experts in predicting exAMD progression.

== ISSUES

Potential ethical issues arise around false positives (system predicts progression in patients in which it doesn't occurr)
and false negatives (system does not predict progression in a patient in which it does occurr). The impact of these false
positives and negatives depends on whether the systems predictions are the only factor in treatment decisions or if it acts
only as an aid to clinicians.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

Its cool that they're utilising pre existing data to aid clinicians to provide preventitive treatment for a disease that affects 
millions of people. The article doesn't mention the means used to train the model.
