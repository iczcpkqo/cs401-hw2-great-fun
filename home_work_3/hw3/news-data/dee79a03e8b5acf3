AGENT

Artefact coordinated by Greenpeace France

GOAL

The first goal of the website "Orizon" is to predict the cost of the houses on the France and Belgium sea coasts in a century given the fact that the sea level will increase.
The second goal is to increase environment awareness, saying that to help your descendant in a century, you must be starting by taking care of the planet.

DATA

Real estate announces, topologic map of France/Belgium given by the NASA with an increase of the sea level by 1 meter corresponding of the estimation given by the report GIEC in 2014 used during CO21.

METHODS

Supervised machine learning with features as surface, square meters, city square meters but also new feature like the distance to sea in 2100.

RESULTS

The result must be measured not by the correct price estimation but by the number of people targeted by this website.
I don't have any number but in my opinion this is a great marketing ploy.

COMMENTS

The website main focus isn't about machine learning but it is always interesting to see how this field was used to attract and aware people.
