GOAL		Imaging in low light
DATA		A dataset of raw short-exposure low-light images, with corresponding long-exposure reference images
METHODS		Using the presented dataset, they develop a pipeline for processing low-light images, based on end-to-end training of a fully-convolutional network. The network operates directly on raw sensor data and replaces much of the traditional image processing pipeline, which tends to perform poorly on such data.
