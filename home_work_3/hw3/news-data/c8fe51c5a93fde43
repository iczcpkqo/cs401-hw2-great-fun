It was 2016 and Microsoft was trying to introduce a friendly AI chatbot for entertainment purposes in the U.S. Although it was a great idea, the implementation was not as expected. As a result, the chatbot had to be shutdown until they were 'confident' enough. The article seems legit as it provides link to an official Microsoft blogpost written by Peter Lee, the then Corpoarate VP, Microsoft Healthcare.
