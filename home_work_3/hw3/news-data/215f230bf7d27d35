GOAL

Using data to solve problems adopting more diverse set of tools.

DATA

Think of the data as being generated bya black box in which a vector of input variables x (independent variables) go in one side, and on the other side the response variables y come out. Inside the black box, nature functions to associate the predictor variables with the response variables.

METHODS

The analysis in this culture starts with assuming a stochastic data model for the inside of the black box. For example, a common data model is that data are generated by independent draws from response variables = f(predictor variables, random noise, parameters). The analysis in this culture considers the inside of the box complex and unknown. Their approach is to find a function fxâ€”an algorithm that operates on x to predict the responses y.

RESULTS

Higher predictive accuracy is associated with more reliable information about the underlying data mechanism. Weak predictive accuracy can lead to questionable conclusions.
Algorithmic models can give better predictive accuracy than data models, and provide better information about the underlying mechanism.

COMMENTS

Late. Leo Breiman had a great research using Data models but it is not necessary to use Data Models. Here the emphasis needs to be on problem and data.
