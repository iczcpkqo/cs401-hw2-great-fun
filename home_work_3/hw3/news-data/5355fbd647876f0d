== AGENT

Who did this machine-learning-related work (e.g., Netflix)

== GOAL

An artificial intelligence (AI) system for rapid COVID-19 detection

== DATA

11,356 CT volumes scans from three centers in China and four publicly available databases of 
COVID-19, influenza-A/B, non-viral community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and non-pneumonia subjects.

== METHODS

Supervised

== RESULTS

The AI system has been comprehensively validated on large multi-class datasets with higher diagnosis performance than human experts in diagnosing COVID-19.

== ISSUES

The classification was based on lesion segmentation result, and the lesion segmentation DICE index was ~0.662, which is not an accurate representation of lesions.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

I found this interesting and useful. I believe AI could out perform humans in the efficiency of testing and
contact tracing. I think this rapid COVID-19 identification is a step in that direction. It also has the 
potential to diagnose you with COVID-19 without having a swab up your poor nostril.
