== GOAL

Demonstrate the advantages of using modern neural networks to analyze WWII photographs

== DATA

Finnish Wartime Photograph archive containing 160,000 photographs

== METHODS

Supervised

== RESULTS

The machine could automatically detect people and objects in a variety of scenes and even distinguish 
photographers on the basis of characteristics in the image—all much faster than any manual reviewing process.
The AI model achieved a classification accuracy of 41.1 per cent. (20.1—69.7 per cent).

== ISSUES

Could be more accurate, many photos harder to distinguish.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

I find this very interesting. It is a good approach to archives around the world.
I can understand many photographs being hard to distinguish and difficult to preprocess.
