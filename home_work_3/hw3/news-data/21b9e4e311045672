== GOAL

Uses AI to create rap lyrics

== DATA

Compiled a list of 104 popular English-speaking rap artists and
scraped all their songs available on a popular lyrics website. 
In total, 583 669 lines from 10 980 songs inputed.

== METHODS

Supervised. Deep neural network

== RESULTS

Mixed

== ISSUES

Music is subjective, so hard to create AI software based on this.
Needs larger dataset if to be somewhat successful.

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

While an interesting idea, I do not think it will be anything more than that.
Like with creating artwork, AI struggles to be creative. Medium press coverage.
Would be interesting to encorporate lyrics into an AI made rap song.
