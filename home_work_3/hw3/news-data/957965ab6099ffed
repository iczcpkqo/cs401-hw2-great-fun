GOAL

Finding a more cost-effective system for environmental regulators and to predict failing regulators.

DATA

Past inspections from different facilities.

METHODS

From the data, they created prediction models on facility characteristics.

RESULTS

As a result, it produced a risk factor or score on how likely a facility will fail the inspection.

COMMENTS

Although the idea seems great, it does go on to show that there is a flaw within the system. I am not sure how likely it will go onto production how damaging the flaw is to the system.
