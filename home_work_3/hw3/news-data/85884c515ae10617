Develop an app on mobile phone gto help nurses detect cases of jaundice in newborn babies

== METHODS

Not mentioned

== RESULTS
On the first trial, cases who needed treatment were identified 100% of the time and cases who didn't need treatment, 60% of the time

== ISSUES

There doesnâ€™t seem to be any issues

== SCORE
9

== COMMENTS

This method is interesting as it only requires a smartphone and will help detect jaundice faster and in a more reliable way. However, it seems that 37 babies is a small number
