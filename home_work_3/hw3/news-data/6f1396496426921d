Harshit Parmar a doctoral student at Texas Tech University



== GOAL



Detecting Alzheimer's earlier in patients using a machine learning algorithm



== DATA



What data did they use: what did it look like and how did they get it?
fMRI scans which can measure minute changes in blood oxygen levels in the brain. 
Since the data was 4D (brain scan over time) they developed a convolutional neural 
network architecture that could handle the fMRI data. 



== METHODS



A nuclear density and a nuclear density-confidence interval (ND-CI) algorithm was developed. 
To develop this algorithm a data bank of 811 HRME images was acquired. Supervised ML



== RESULTS



The ND-CI algorithm had a 6% increase in positive predictive value (PPV) and 
3% increase in negative predictive value over the ND algorithm.



== ISSUES



fMRI images contain a lot of noise which would make it difficult to predict earlier Alzheimer's.

== SCORE

7



== COMMENTS



The algorithm used was an improvement on an already existing algorithm. 
In the article they don't state if the research was successful and if so how successful. 
The idea is interesting and can definitely help people if it keeps improving.
