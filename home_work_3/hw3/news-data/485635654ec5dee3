In some families, not everyone has their own account book, but a family shares the same account book. Does it mean that the husband only needs to log in to wife’s account, and then use this account to search wildly for various things he likes but the wife does not What husband like can reduce wife's desire to consume and tilt the balance of manipulating the family economy to husband? If these e-commerce sites give each account a function to reset preferences, will it bring losses to these companies? Is there any chance that the reset data will be recycled back to do some other things? It is too wasteful to delete it directly.
