Applications of Machine Learning in Pharma and Medicine ( https://www.techemergence.com/machine-learning-in-pharma-medicine/ )

AGENT

Researcher Jeffrey Tyner

GOAL

Disease identification and diagnosis of ailments.

DATA

Report issued by Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America in 2015 ( http://phrma-docs.phrma.org/sites/default/files/pdf/oncology-report-2015.pdf )

METHODS

A: Matrix representation of the supervised and unsupervised learning problem B: Decision trees map features to outcome. C: Neural networks predict outcome based on transformed representations of features D: The k-nearest neighbor algorithm assigns class based on the values of the most similar training examples

RESULTS

Developed two functional screening strategies making use of siRNA and small-molecule kinase inhibitor libraries to interrogate the genes and signaling pathways required for growth and viability of malignant cells. 

COMMENTS

It was really smart of Mr. Tyner to implement Machine Learning with Biology. But more intensive AI would be needed to identify cancer at large scale.
