== GOAL

Dicpher (translate) languages that were once thought to be lost to linguists

== DATA

Already dicphered languages (Gothic, Ugaritic) and undeciphered language (Iberian)

== METHODS

Decipherment algorithm, doesn't specify which type of Machine Learning, but from the paper they published and reference to 'Reward' and 'Penalty' I'm guessing Reinforcment Learning. 

== RESULTS

When compared to other state of the art Dicpherment algorithms, they did 11% better in Hebrew/Ugaritic and 15% better for Gothic/Old English

== ISSUES

Since nobody is able to dicpher these languages, how can they validate their results? I can say this word 'aldjkfadf' means 'peacock' but if there is no way to verify it, how can we know? I suppose if it works correctly on other languages thats some basis for validity. 

== SCORE

== COMMENTS

I thought it was a neat approach to the problem of reviving dead languages. I'm not that interested in it, but someone has to do the work. I did find the application of mathematics to this field of linguistics was very interesting to see.
