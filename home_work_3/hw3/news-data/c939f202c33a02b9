== GOAL
Improve machine learning techniques for a global health crisis
== DATA
They repurposed their deep learning models to focus on a specific SARS-CoV-2 protein called its main protease.
== METHODS
They used its models to predict those details for over 100 known protease inhibitors. These models were supervised by Professor Guowei Wei and his team. 
== RESULTS
They came to the conclussion that antibody treatments that resemble what immune systems produce naturally to fight the coronavirus will be most likely the first therapies approved during the pandemic.
== ISSUES
The only issue at the moment is that this team have been limited on time and resources as the pandemic is currently taking place.
== SCORE
8
== COMMENTS
I think that this is interesting to a certain extent as this team kind of gave what was already known as this is already public knowledge. They gave what companies need to do in order to make a cure to the current pandemic which is a bonus.

Penn State University and Houston Methodist Hospital
== GOAL
To scans faces and listens to speech to quickly spot strokes
== DATA
The model relies on computational facial motion analysis and natural language processing to spot sagging muscles, slurred speech or other stroke-like symptoms.
== METHODS
They used an iPhone to record 80 Houston Methodist patients who were experiencing stroke symptoms as they performed a speech test
== RESULTS
The machine learning model performed with 79% accuracy when tested again on that dataset
== ISSUES
There was an inaccuracy of 21% which could be fatal giving the situation at hand.
== SCORE
7
== COMMENTS
I think that the article is interesting but the model still needs to be enhanced but when it does and they build on the information, I believe then it will further the interest.

== AGENT
Netflix
== GOAL
Correct recommendations for the right viewers
== DATA
They split each profile into different taste groups based on what they like to watch to give them more of the same.
== METHODS
Tags are used for the machine learning algorithms to put each profile into the group that suits them. This then gives this group certain recommendations. The data that Netflix feeds into its algorithms can be broken down into two types – implicit and explicit.
== RESULTS
Netflix now gives the correct recommendations based on what you watch.
== ISSUES
Limits what is displayed based on what you have watched to date.
== SCORE
8
== COMMENTS
This article is interesting because Neflix is used by a lot of people daily. It is interesting to learn how the recommendations are put together.

== AGENT
Microsoft
== GOAL
To create a Machine Learning Application That Allows You To Create AI Models Without Coding
== DATA
To create an AI in Lobe, a user first needs to import a collection of images. These images are used as a dataset to train the application
== METHODS
It trains the model on the provided data, creating an AI model optimized to scan images for the user’s specific object or action.
== RESULTS
This application is now available and it is called LOBE. Presently it only supports image classification by categorizing the image to a single label overall.
== ISSUES
It is limited to what it can support and more work needs to be done.
== SCORE
6
== COMMENTS
This article is interesting but is limited as only part of the application has been complete. There would be more information if the application was complete.

== AGENT
CDISE, Moscow, Russia
== GOAL
To detect drivers of atrial fibrillation
== DATA
The team tested their approach on 11 explanted human hearts
== METHODS
Researchers performed the simultaneous optical and multi-electrode mapping of atrial fibrillation episodes induced in the hearts.
== RESULTS
The sample size was too small to give an accurate result but they intend to do more tests with higher numbers.
== ISSUES
The size of the tests they done was limited so there was no accurate outcome to the research.
== SCORE
5
== COMMENTS
This article was informative but there was no actual outcome from their research so it seems like a whole waste of time.

== AGENT
NOAA and Google
== GOAL
To increase the rate and quality of assimilating environmental data with the intent of improving the  weather monitoring and forecasting
== DATA
They captured data and imagery from its current weather satellites and fed that data into what they hoped to create. 
== METHODS
They created machine learning systems related to specific areas like weather forecasting
== RESULTS
They are currently working through the process of creating the system so there are no offical results to date.
== ISSUES
The time to create such systems is the main factor in this article. Another is funding as only a certain amount was approved.

== COMMENTS
This is a very interesting article as the weather effect everyone on a daily basis and it is interest to see how people are using the power of computers to find out information about what to expect from the earth's weather
