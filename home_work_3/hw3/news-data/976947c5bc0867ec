AGENT

Google Street Learn

GOAL

The goal of Google street learn is to navigate a around a city or area using only landmarks and points of intrest without GPS or refrence map

DATA

Using refrence images from google street view it crops 360-degree panoramic images each measuing 84x84 pixels.
Each is a node in a larger netowrk of images 

METHODS

The system learns using deep reinforcement learning. a process that uses a series of multi-layered neural networks.
Street Learn uses neural networks 

One that handles image recognition, it feeds data to two Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, allowing the system to consider contextual data.

One of the LSTMs is a policy network that decides the action the agent should take next based on its current reward state,

The other is a network that is tasked with memorising the local environment, 

RESULTS

The result was as expected. StreetLearn can learn to traverse most cities from photos without gps

COMMENTS

Street learn is a smart alternative to using gps but only in city or built up area as it would be uselss in areas without landmarks or points of interest
