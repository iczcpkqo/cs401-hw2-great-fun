== AGENT
MIT

== GOAL
Show how using certain training data can cause an AI to become "psychopathic"

== DATA
Fed only images of people dying, taken from reddit

== METHODS
Taught to perform image captioning

== RESULTS
Scarily, they truly created a psychotic AI. When administered a Rorschach inkblot test, it constantly saw significantly more disturbing images compared to a regularly trained AI. 

== ISSUES
The researchers never showed Norman actual images of a person dying for ethical reasons, merely the captions that went with those images. 

== SCORE
9, but terrifying. 

== COMMENTS
Shows how if an AI is fed biased data, it can easily cause it to become psychotic
