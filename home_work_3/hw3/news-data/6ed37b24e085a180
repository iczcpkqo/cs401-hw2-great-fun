== AGENT

iNaturalist

== GOAL

To map and share observations of biodiversity across the globe

== DATA

Uses large database of the "research grade" observations built by its users.

== METHODS

Unsupervised neural network

== RESULTS

iNaturalist has captured 3.8 million observations from over 350,000 contributors, spanning more than 100,000 species

== ISSUES

Low quality observations, problems with misidentifications because of poorly informed AI.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

Interesting use of AI, uses modern neural networks to spread awareness for biodiversity.
Reporting from press has died down since 2018. Method not fully disclosed to public.
As low quality observations cause problems, I would only allow use in certain conditons,
eg lighting, good camera quality
