== AGENT

The text was generated by using the latest neural network model for language, called GPT-3, released by the American artificial intelligence research company OpenAI. (GPT: Generative Pre-trained Transformer.)

GPT-3 needs a prompt of some kind to start it off. The Guardian’s staff gave the model instructions and some opening sentences to the Robot!

== GOAL

Goal was to make a Robot/software write an article.

== DATA

Data used was some model instructions including words, numbers and start off opening sentences.

== METHODS

GPT-3 is a text modelling algorithm and it had to be trained. Hence, it used Supervised Learning Method.

== RESULTS

Result was a long coherent and stylistically consistent article written by a Robot(The software used to produce it is called a “generative model"). Though instructions had to be feeded and the article had to be edited by humans, the whole generated article by just giving some idea was an astonishing thing.

== ISSUES

Sometimes, the reviews/ideas produced are very random and inappropriate. It might also hurt someone's emotions if given wrong inputs.  

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

Overall, the article and use of GPT(here GPT is used) is very interesting. It is of great essence now on how software/AI/Technology behaves and work with humans.

I totally agree with the author of this article on "The conversion", as he said, "A useful idea for thinking about this is “co-creativity”. This means using generative tools to spark new ideas, or to generate some components for our creative work.
Where an AI creates complete works, such as a complete article, the human becomes the curator or editor. We roll our very sophisticated dice until we get a result we’re happy with".
