== GOAL
The goal is to explore the benefits of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for enhancing NOAAâ€™s use of satellite and environmental data.
== DATA
Satellite images and other environmental data.
== METHODS
Use a system based AI for different projects such as monitoring under sea environments and try to predict future weather with past weather forcasts
== RESULTS
Results are still awaiting, but they have published that they were able to detect RIP currents from coastal imagery using with computer vision based software
== ISSUES
No issues so far, or I can't find anything.
== SCORE
3
== COMMENTS
Wasn't too interesting and very difficult to find any information on the systems
