AGENT

Yelp

GOAL

Classify pictures of restaurants into five categories. These categories are food, drink, inside, outside, and menu.

DATA

Pictures with obvious captions, pictures that users have given certain attributes to, and specific pictures taken just for more data.

METHODS

Used a convolution neural network based on an open source framework called Caffe. They wrapped this convolution neural network using the container platform Docker.

RESULTS

Precision of 94 percent and recall of 70 percent on a data set of 2500 pictures. Yelp is able to use this for cover photo diversification and tabbed photo browsing.

COMMENTS

Users are able to report pictures if they are placed in the wrong category, allowing the algorithms to improve over time. Also, I was surprised to see a company like Yelp using open source material.
