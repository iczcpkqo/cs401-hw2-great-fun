== AGENT


Ocado


== GOAL


Create entirely automated warehouses and reduce food waste.


== DATA


It collects data for the robots navigation, pick up orders, for the maintenance and efficiency of the robots. Also Temperature and expiration date of food products.


== METHODS


Reinforcement Learning. It gets real time data from other robots, stock and product details.


== RESULTS


In just 5 minutes robotics can complete 50,000 orders. It helps reduce food spoilage by monitoring temperature and expiration date and ML helps monitoring the donation of products that are only a few days away from expiring.


== ISSUES


No issues that I can think of now.


== SCORE


7


== COMMENTS


I think a warehouse is a great place for robots and not for people.
