== GOAL

Use machine learning to to get the right titles in front of each of their members at the right time 

== DATA

Under their online exploration scheme, they obtained a training dataset that records, for each (member, title, image) tuple, whether that selection resulted in a play of the title or not.

== METHODS

Supervised learning models or contextual bandit counterparts with Thompson Sampling, LinUCB, or Bayesian methods that intelligently balance making the best prediction with data exploration.

== RESULTS

They’ve taken the first steps in personalizing the selection of artwork for their recommendations and across the service. This has resulted in a meaningful improvement in how members discover new content and they’ve rolled it out to all their customers

== ISSUES

We also carefully determine the label for each observation by looking at the quality of engagement to avoid learning a model that recommends “clickbait” images: ones that entice a member to start playing but ultimately result in low-quality engagement.
Possible issue- How to include variety outside the viewers perceived comfort zones/familiarities.	

== SCORE

5

== COMMENTS

Useful time saving application of machine learning. Accurate reports in the press and any user of Netflix will appreciate the personalised experience. 
Interesting new approach to advertising content to users.
