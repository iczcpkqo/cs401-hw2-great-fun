AGENT

Yelp

GOAL

Photo classification

DATA

Images

METHODS

multiple convolutional layers (for extracting spatially local and translation-invariant features), ReLU (Rectified Linear Units) layers (for non-saturating activations), pooling layers (for down-sampling and translation-invariance), local response normalization layers (for better generalization) and fully-connected layers as in conventional feedforward neural networks. Softmax outputs and regularization methods such as dropout

RESULTS

Tabbed photo browsing implemented

COMMENTS

Still work to be done
