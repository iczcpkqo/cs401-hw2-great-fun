== GOAL

Predict traffic to improve Google Maps real time ETA accuracy

== DATA

Live traffic conditions, historical traffic patterns and graphs produced from local road networks.
Where each node corresponds to a route segment and edges connect nodes that are on the same road or
connected through intersections.

== METHODS

A message passing algorithm run on a Graph Neural Network where the messages and their effects on the nodes
and edges are learned using 'Supervised Reinforcement Learning'

== RESULTS

Improved accuracy of real time ETAs by upto 50%

== ISSUES

Result advertised as improving accuracy by upto 50%. However, later on in the article, it is stated that Google Maps
already predicts ETAs with 97% accuracy so this improvement is only on the 3% error rate.

== SCORE

4

== COMMENTS

The work on predicting traffic is really interesting but it has been applied to improve a system that already does its
job really well so seems to be a bit of a waste. However, they do get some brownie points for designing the model to 
learn to dynamically adapt the learning rate automatically.
