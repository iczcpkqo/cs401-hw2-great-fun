== COMMENTS

This press article was interesting to me as I was able to think of the affect of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning on the day to day life of the people.
How a mistake in the faulty trained system can cause an impact of the livelyhood of the people. If an AI based firing system was created by Uber it should have been tested thoroughly
and a manual intervention could have been done to validate the firing. This could have been acheieved by creation of a report pointing out the weights which might have caused the termination.
