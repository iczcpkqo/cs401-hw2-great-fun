== GOAL

To forecast locations of aftershocks after an earthquake, and thus improve earthquake warning systems

== DATA

Trained on a set of more than 131,000 mainshock–aftershock pairs, then tested on an independent test dataset of more than 30,000 mainshock–aftershock pairs.

== METHODS

To build and train the neural networks, the team used the Python toolkit Keras, which provides a high-level application programming interface to access the Theano and TensorFlow deep-learning libraries. The networks were trained using Theano, an adaptive learning rate (Adadelta) optimization method22, and a binary cross-entropy cost function.

== RESULTS

The neural network could predict the locations of aftershocks more accurately (area under curve of 0.849) than can classic Coulomb failure stress change (area under curve of 0.583)
