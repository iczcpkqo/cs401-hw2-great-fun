== GOAL

To produce an AI that can sucessfully classify Covid-19 detected in CT scans

== DATA

https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/LIDC-IDRI)  This is only a portion of the data.

== METHODS

Supervised classification of images and 3d data.

== RESULTS

90% accuracy in detecting pneumonia
84% accuracy in detecting postive covid cases
93% accuracy in classifying negative covid cases

== ISSUES

While this is interesting, it is still relatively inaccurate when considering that predicting covid positive will be wrong
for approximately 3 out of every 20 people. And 7 out of 100 could be misclassified as covid-negative. A useful tool to assist
in diagnoses but should not be standalone.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

Pretty cool that it can detect the difference between Influenza and Covid based on a CT scan of lung damage. Despite the issues mentioned above,
it could be a good screening tool to expedite treatment. The fact that CT scans can be used to detect covid in asymptomatic people
also makes this very interesting.
