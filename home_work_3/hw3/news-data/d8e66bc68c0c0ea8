== AGENT

Google DeepMind 

== GOAL

Create a machine that plays Go at or above the level of professional Go players

== DATA

Trained from scratch, played numerous games against amateurs,
Then played against different versions of itself thousands of times, learning from its own mistakes

== METHODS

- Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Monte Carlo Tree Search
- Artificial Neural Network

== RESULTS

October 2015
- AlphaGo won the first ever game against a Go professional with a score of 5-0.

March 2016
- AlphaGo then won against professional player Lee Sedol, who won 18 world titles
- During the games, AlphaGo played several inventive winning moves, several of which were so surprising that they upended hundreds of years of wisdom

== ISSUES

None

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

Great integration of AI Search, Optimisation, hardware specific algorithms and Machine Learning
Massive speed increases in using specialised hardware to calculate moves
