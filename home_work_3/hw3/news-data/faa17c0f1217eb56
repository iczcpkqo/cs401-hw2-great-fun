== AGENT
 IBM’s “Watson for Oncology”

== GOAL
diagnose and treat and ill patients.

== DATA
symptoms and treatments for a range of illnesses.

== METHODS
the system contained knowledge and symptoms of every illness, from common cold to rare disease. 
It collected a patient's symptomns to assess if they had an illness, and to identify it. The database was also full of
treatment methods for a particular disease.

== RESULTS
the project was scrapped following several serious problems. The AI's performance of diagnosing patients
was significantly worse than that of standard doctors. It sometimes also gave bad, even dangerous, recommendations
for treating patients, in one instance, suggesting a woman who was already bleeding badly, to take treatment that would 
have caused her to bleed even worse.

== ISSUES
The AI based its calulations and predictions on hypothetical patients, rather than real ones. When put into action,
the hypothetical cases diverged greatly from the real cases, resulting in poor performance, and a $62 million hole in the ground.

== SCORE
1

== COMMENTS
for what seemed like a hopeful and life saving instrument, the Watson AI only highlighted the difficulty in bringing AI into the
clinic, where it was hopelessly outmatched by trained doctors knowledge and experience.
