AGENT

Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCSI)

GOAL

Detect the likelihood that a given news outlet will publish "fake" (that is, unfactual) news, and within that, detect the political alignment of the assertions (if there is one).

DATA

Data from Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC), a website with human fact-checkers who analyse the accuracy and biases of more than 2,000 news sites.

METHODS

Data was fed into an SVM programmed to classify news sites the same way as MBFC.

RESULTS

When given a new news outlet, the system was 65 per cent accurate at detecting whether it has a high, low or medium level of "factuality", and roughly 70 per cent accurate in detecting if it is left-leaning, right-leaning or moderate. As to be expected, "fake news" outlets were found to be more likely to use language that is hyperbolic, subjective and emotional.
