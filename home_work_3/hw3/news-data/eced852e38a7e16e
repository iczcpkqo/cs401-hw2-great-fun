GOAL

To create artistic images of high perceptual quality, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images.

DATA

Images of artworks and any given photograph.

METHODS

Convolutional Neural Network consisting of layers of essentially image filters, each of which extracts a certain feature from the input image. The output of a given layer consists of so-called feature maps, differently filtered versions of the input image. When Convolutional Neural Networks are trained on object recognition, they develop a representation of the image that makes object information increasingly explicit along the processing hierarchy. To obtain a representation of the style of an input image, they use a feature space originally designed to capture texture information. This feature space is built on top of the filter responses in each layer of the network.

RESULTS

The results of this is the ability to render a given photograph in the style of a range of well-known artworks. 

COMMENTS

This produces very visually appealing images in any given artists style. Whether you can call this algorithm's creations anything more than mimicry is up for debate. It raises philisophical questions that probably aren't as interesting as the images it produces.
