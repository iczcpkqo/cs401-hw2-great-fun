GOAL 

Attempt to create abstract art using Machine Learning, which can be static or dynamic art.

DATA 

No previous data was used - the images are generated using functions and iterations over the same image.

METHODS 

They used Pattern Producing neural networks, which allows for randomly generated neural networks with iteration to produce abstract images.

RESULTS 

With enough iterations, the algorithm was able to produce very complex and in certain cases, moving imagery using Pattern Producing neural networking.

COMMENTS 

Although this may not have an obvious use in a practical scenario, it also is fascinating that abstract art can be produced using machine learning. I feel it could potentially be used with tweaking to expand its usage case to detecting patterns within photographs.
