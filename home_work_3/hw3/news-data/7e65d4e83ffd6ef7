== GOAL

Use machine learning to catalogue a range of emotion-specific facial expressions in mice.

== DATA

Mice were exposed to a diverse set of sensory stimuli such as tail shocks, sweet sucrose, bitter quinine andlithium chloride injections, which induce visceral malaise,
as well as freezing and escape behaviours.
The mice's heads were locked in position while their reactions to the senosry stimuli were video monitored. 
A dataset of their facial movement for each emotion event was created.

== METHODS

Supervised

== RESULTS

Six specific facial expressions associated with six specific emotions were catalogued.
Pain from tail shock, disgust from bitter quinine, pleasure from sweet sucrose, malaise from lithium chloride, fear from freezing, flight from escaping

== ISSUES

Animal experimentation. Holding mouse head in place while shocking tail or injecting lithium chloride.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

I believe this study was intersting. I think machine learning has the potential to further understand animal communication.
This facial expression recognition in mice brings us closer to understanding and identifying animal emotions.
This shows a potential in expanding the facial expression catalogue in many more animals and even learning their verbal expressions.
Could ML learn how to speak with dolphins?:o
