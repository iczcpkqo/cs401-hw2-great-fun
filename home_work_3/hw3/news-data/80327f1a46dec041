Infervision 

== GOAL

Using AI And Deep Learning To Diagnose Cancer

== DATA

Real-life data from previous scan images to increase the model’s accuracy at identifying signs of cancerous growth in lung scans.

== METHODS

CNN machine learning model, which has already been trained with over 100,000 chest CT scans 

== RESULTS

“It usually takes a physician 10 to 30 minutes to read a CT scan, while Infervision AI only takes 5 seconds. Human eyes can easily miss lesions less than 3mm, but AI can accurately detect them and assists physicians for the optimal diagnosis of each patient.
Assisted with over 100,000 image diagnostic cases. It is breaking the record of AI image screening in the medical AI industry.

== ISSUES

Ethically is it ok to put the health of a human in the hands of a computer algorithm?

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

Expand it to all forms of cancer, not just lung. Can its understanding of tumours be transferred into predicting success of treatments?
