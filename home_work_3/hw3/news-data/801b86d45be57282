== COMMENTS

I found Ocado to be a very interesting example of using machine learning in every process of its business almost akin to vertical integration. They have AI to manage its warehouses improve throughput and reduce food waste, AI to plan delivery driver routes to avoid traffic delays and AI to prevent fraud in the payment process.
