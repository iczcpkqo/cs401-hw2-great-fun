AGENT

Facebook

GOAL

To be able to detect with considerable confidence whether two images represent the same person or not, preferably without concern for surrounding light, camera angles and colors on face. 

DATA

Template based on a person's facial features. Attributes within this template describe things like the juxtaposition of certain characteristics on the frame of the face. The Facebook team used more than 4 million facial images of more than 4000 people to feed training data to the learning system. 

METHODS

When a square box starts appearing over faces in facebook photos, this is a feature designed to let a user tag their friends. Facebook use a facial recognition software called DeepFace to map attributes of facial characteristics to a real person. The four stages in the data pipeline consist of: detect, align, represent, and classify. When you add 3D transformation and piece-wise affine transformation, the algorithm becomes more and more accurate. A face representation is derived from a nine-layer deep neural network. Layers do not have weight sharing deployed which is the contrary to standard convolution layers. 


RESULTS

DeepFace detects whether two faces in different photos are of the same person with 97.47% accuracy, regardless of lighting conditions or angles. As a comparison, humans generally have an average of 97.65% accuracy. This means that Facebookâ€™s facial processing software has nearly the same accuracy as humans. The output of the algorithm is a face representation derived from a nine-layer neural network which holds more than 120 million variables, each mapped to various local layers.
