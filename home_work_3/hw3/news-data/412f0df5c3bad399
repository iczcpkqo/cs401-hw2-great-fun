== AGENT

DeepMind

== GOAL

AlphaGo Zero.
An AI that teaches itself the game of Go from scratch with no human intervention.

== DATA

Basic rules of Go.

== METHODS

Novel form of Reinforcement Learning. To begin the system has a neural network that 
knows nothing about Go. It then plays games agasinst itself by pairing the neural 
network with a powerful search algorithm. As it plays, the neural network is tuned and 
updated to predict moves as well as the eventual winner of the games. This updated network
is recombined with the search algorithm to create a stronger version of the system.
Then the process begins again. With each iteration the system improves and the quality of 
the self play games increases. This technique is more powerful than previous versions of AlphaGo
since it is no longer constrained by the limits of human knowledge.

== RESULTS

3 days - surpasses AlphaGo Lee, the version that beat world champion Go player Lee Sedol in 4/5 games in 2016.
21 days - reaches level of AlphaGo Master, the version that beat 60 top Go professionals online and the world champion Ke Jie in 3/3 games in 2017.
40 days - surpasses all other versions of AlphaGo and becomes arguably the best Go player in the world. 

== ISSUES

Takes the oldest board game in the world, designed to test human strategy and ingenuity and make it trivial. 
Many people have dedicated their lives to mastering the game and they will never be the best.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

Super cool that the system started with nothing and then in a matter of days had out done all previous systems. 
What's more is that this was achieved with only a single neural network (previous systems used two). 
This was reported in a technical blog post on DeepMind's website so is not sensationalised and seems to stay true
to the integrity of academic reporting. It would be interesting to see DeepMind apply this technique to train a system
to play an online multiplayer video game rife with cheaters, such as CSGO, and see if it can out perform them.
