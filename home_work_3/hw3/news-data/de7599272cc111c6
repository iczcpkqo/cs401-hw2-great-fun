== AGENT

Levich Institute

== GOAL

To predict the result of the election

== DATA

Over a billion mined twitter posts, which were then georeferenced to help predict state by state and electoral college results. 

== METHODS

Not Specified, I would guess a supervised model on twitter posts used to inform a clustering algorithm on people 
based upon their positive or negative posts about the different politicians. Georeference the clusters and you have a voting sample.

== RESULTS

They predicted Joe Biden had the advantage in the election by a small margin.

== ISSUES

The AI suffers from similar issues to polling, incomplete or biased samples, data was acquired mainly from social media
with significant voting groups having less access skewing the data.

== SCORE

4

== COMMENTS

Reminded me of cambridge analytica.The article didn't have a lot of information about how the model worked 
seemed a bit like click bait. But interesting that this model supposedly predicted the previous american election result 
which seemed against the odds to most. Would have been higher in cool factor with more information.
