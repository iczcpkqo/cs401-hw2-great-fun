== AGENT
iPhone X facial recognition.

== GOAL
Unlocks iPhone if it recognises the users face via its front camera.

== DATA
Takes an image of the users' face and stores it in the iPhone's system. Unstructured 
data, as it would identify parts of a person's face and deduce whether it is the user or not.

== METHODS
When first used, the iPhone's camera records the user's face, and creates a 3-D representation 
of the it. The system adapts to the user wearing make-up, glasses, scarfs or other partial 
facial coverings, to still allow the user to be recognised.

== RESULTS
Overall, the model worked very well, it is still being run on all newer iPhone models, albeit with 
updated features and performance. However, it is not 'bulletproof' by any means. Apple themselves quote 
the probability of a random person unlocking the iPhone via face recognition at 1 in 1,000,000. This is 
not exactly 'iron clad' or minimalistic.

== ISSUES
As mentioned, there is still a chance of someone managing to beat this AI facial recognition, purely by just
looking at the phone. Also, the probability reduces substantially when considering family members, or even an identical
twin, given the likeness they may share to the user, resulting in the iPhone falsely recognising this person
as the user.

== SCORE
8

== COMMENTS
The fact that facial recognition is still running on all newer iPhone models since the iPhone X says a lot about 
the success of the feature, and its popularity with Apple's customers. 100% success is a pipe dream with this sort 
of technology, but Apple definitely were not far off it here.
