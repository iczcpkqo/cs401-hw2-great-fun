GOAL

The objetive of this project was to make a software that can recognise objects analysing pictures.

DATA

It uses a pictures database, with the pictures stored following a CNN architecture.

METHODS

This system uses mainly Convolutional neural networks (CNN). It consist of 5 convolutional layers, followed by 3 fully connected layers.

RESULTS

The result of this project is a software that recognises very efficiently what objet is shown in a picture.

COMMENTS

This software can be use with some programmes as Matlab, to have a efficient computer vision system.
