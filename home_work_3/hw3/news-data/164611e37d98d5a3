== AGENT

University of Waterloo

== GOAL

A radical new technique lets AI learn with practically no data

== DATA

MNIST-handwritten digit database.

== METHODS

kNN (SLaPkNN classifier), LO-shot Learning

== RESULTS

A simple classifier likeSLaPkNN can perform LO-shot learning

== ISSUES

This is a novel case study and further reasearch is being carried out to increase its compatibility with popular learning models.

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

LO-shot Learning can effectively reduce the volume of data that may be required to train a model by soft labelling and condensing data. LO-shot technique a is work in progress and plans to achieve compatibility with other well known models like DNN that trains efficiently with less or condensed data.
