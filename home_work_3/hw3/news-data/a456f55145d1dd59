GOAL

To achieve an artificial intelligence which can find a proper solution from a bad system by fine tuning model parameters.

DATA

The main approach of machine learning algorithm (ML) is based on the NeuroEvolution (or neuro-evolution). This form of machine learning uses evolutionary algorithms such as a genetic algorithm (GA) to train artificial neural networks (ANN).

So for this example, we can say ML = GA + ANN.

METHODS

Uses Machine Learning Genetic Algorithm which is used to train and improve neural networks. Genetic algorithm is a search-based optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics. It uses the same combination of selection, crossover and mutation to evolve initial random population.

RESULTS

we have successfully implemented AI robot for learning how to play the Flappy Bird game. As a result of several iterations, we can get an almost invincible player.

COMMENTS

I believe the neurons in hidden layer could be changed further ahead. Furthermore, changing some physical parameters such as the distance between barriers, gravity would give the game a different feel.
