== AGENT

Cornell University

== GOAL

Monitor household appliances through vibrations on a wall or ceiling, creating a centralized smart home system

== DATA

What data did they use: what did it look like and how did they get it?

== METHODS

A laser doppler vibrometer that measures vibrations on the ceilings or walls of a home and a deep learning model to analyse those signals. The deep learning model was trained with samples of individual appliance signals beforehand. (supervised)

== RESULTS

In tests undertaken across five households over two days, the VibroSense prototype could identify the activities of 18 different common household objects with a 96% accuracy rate â€“ even when the appliances were spread across different rooms and floors. This included picking out the signals generated by an electric kettle, a range hood, a microwave, a washing machine, an exhaust fan and even a dripping tap. In addition, the device was capable of distinguishing between different stages of individual appliance use with an average accuracy of more than 97%.

== ISSUES

Privacy issues probably, the devices could easily be used to spy on you or your neighbors. But is it really any more of a problem than amazon echo dot or google nest

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

Great reporting done, I liked the more detailed explination of the techonology and the statistical analysis. But they also didnt go over the top and scare of the general public with heavy mathematics. Also any article that mentions LASERS, I'm immediately a big fan of.
