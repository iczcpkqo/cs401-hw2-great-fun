== AGENT

NVIDIA
 
== GOAL

Train a game simulator that can model nature of the environment

== DATA

50000 Pac-Man episodes provided by BANDAI NAMCO(creators of the game)

== METHODS

Generative Adversarial Networks, Reinforcement Learning

== RESULTS

GameGAN learns to follow the user command - how Pac-Man moves and other rules of the game such as disentangle 
 static components (background and blue wall) from dynamic components (the firball-shooting enemies)

== ISSUES

NONE

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

GameGan is a very interesting model, it could allow to create more complex simulators, which can be used to devolop 
autonomous machines, in this simulators machines can be trained before being test in the real world. 
Regarding the press's reporting, it was reasonably accurate in terms of technical explanation.
What is new here is the model used, it is remarkable the design of the neural network wich has enabled the 
environment's modelling.
