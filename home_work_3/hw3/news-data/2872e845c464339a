== AGENT

University of Helsinki

== GOAL

Use signals from the brain to generate images of what the user is thinking

== DATA

31 participants were instructed to passively watch images and mentally focus on the images that match a certain criteria as the brain activity was recorded with an EEG

== METHODS

Generative neural network with neuroadaptive brain interfacing, Generative adversarial network

== RESULTS

Their experiment provided strong evidence that neuroadaptive modelling is highly effective in generating previously non-exsiting information matching the human operators inteded perceptual categories

== ISSUES

I see no issues with trying to advance technology that may one day help treat a variety of brain disorders. The only real issue is this type of technology like all state of the art technologys will only be available to rich people in rich countries

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

If you can recreate an image of what someone is thinking from just their brain waves!!! YES!!! I'm all about that. The next step is to upload our conciousness into machines and live forever!!!!
