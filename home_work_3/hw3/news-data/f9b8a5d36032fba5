== GOAL

Set a base-line for AI-Augmented future in the workforce

== DATA

To facilitate human-AI augmentation, organizations need to hone the new discipline of objectively viewing job roles as collections of tasks. The extent of this augmentation cannot be taken lightly as the potential productivity improvements will prove to be massive. Much of this work will fall on HR’s shoulders, requiring HR to first retool itself to usher in the augmented workforce.

== METHODS

They implemened the cognitive task master model.


Within the cognitive task master model, they analyzed tasks according to three criteria: the social interaction each task entails, the creativity and strategy required and whether it is transactional/oriented toward optimization. To establish the human-AI balance for cognitively-oriented jobs, businesses once again need to assess the level of social interaction required for individual tasks, the level of creativity and strategic thinking required, and whether it is transactional in nature and geared toward optimizing an outcome. A key component of assessing the transactional nature of tasks is whether the task happens in isolation from other variables and inputs or is highly constrained in its variable set. For example, a purely transactional task requiring low social interaction (bottom left quadrant), such as capturing data for invoice processing, can be automated very simply and has a predefined set of variables/inputs. On the other hand, a highly social and strategically-oriented task (upper right quadrant), such as running a design thinking workshop, cannot be entirely automated, particularly presenting and engaging with participants. Other elements of this task could be augmented by AI, such as providing prompts via an audio headset when presenting. For tasks with low social requirements but high creativity (lower right quadrant), such as writing a report, AI will slowly creep into this area but not anytime soon.  For highly social tasks that are fairly transactional in nature (top left quadrant), such as delivering a prepared presentation at a conference, machines will not be doing this anytime soon.

 

== RESULTS

Successfully leading an augmented workforce requires an entirely different approach from what was needed in the past. Leaders need to think beyond incremental improvements in outcomes, such as improving efficiency and costs by 5% a year, and instead aim for step function changes, where improvements of 25% or even 50% can be achieved. Leaders need to instill the right mindset within the workforce to imagine and action these goals. The following skills can help enhance the “leadership quotient:” ❙❙Encourage adaptability. In a recent survey,14 85% of executives said AI would allow their company to maintain a competitive edge. With that much interest, everyone is facing increased  competition. Incorporating Agile methodologies is essential. For example, ING has implemented 350 nine-person squads consisting of members from varying business functions to increase agility. The insurer is now releasing software updates on a two- to three-week basis rather than five to six times a year, and has improved customer satisfaction and employee engagement scores.


 Leadership needs to define a core vision for its workforce that looks beyond profitability and revenue, and instead focuses on the “why” message: Why are you pursuing the AI augmentation initiative? An example of why this is important is the public backlash to the state of Arkansas’s implementation of AI in its Medicaid program.16 Here AI was primarily used as a cost take-out initiative but failed citizens when insufficient human oversight was applied to monitoring the system’s decisions. Three steps can ensure the organization is guided by a consistent vision:
❙>Clearly set out the ideals of your organization that you will live and die by.
❙>Ensure leadership is easily accessible to teams within the business units. 
❙>Incentivize the workforce on KPIs and outcomes that align with the vision, such as customer or employee satisfaction.❙❙Empower employees. Leaders need to empower and motivate teams to engage in the “blue” work within their roles. An example of this is UK retailer Dixons Carphone, which uses a bot to suggest add-on items and services to customers, and automatically checks store inventory based on employee questioning, allowing employees to spend more time with consumers on the shop floor. Actions to take include:
❙>Reduce hierarchical structures internally and encourage collective decision making and feedback.
❙>Make innovation a cornerstone through design-thinking workshops, hackathons and sprints.
❙>Set clear objectives for teams and allow them the freedom to meet them however they see fit.

This report is a useful case study on human interaciton wih AI and Mahcine Learning is it highlighs the steps that would need to be taken in order to full integrate such a system within an organisation.
