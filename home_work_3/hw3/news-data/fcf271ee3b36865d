== AGENT

IBM

== GOAL

They are trying to create an AI able to analyse in real time the images of
video monitoring in the airport. The final goal is to allow a better and 
faster reaction in crisis situations, as abandoned luggages or dubious behaviour.

== DATA

The data used come from the videos already recorded in several airports.

== METHODS

Not mentioned, probably supervised

== RESULTS

For now, the AI is able to recognize a person or an object on distances of 10,
15 or 100 meters. However it is for now impossible to determine whether something
is dubious or not.

== ISSUES

The biggest technical issue is the lack of processable images. For example, to 
train the AI to recognize an abandoned bag, the database need to contains a 
huge number of pictures representing this situation. However, a bag that is a few
meters away from his owner is not necessarily abandoned.
Moreover, to be applied to airports and train station, the AI has to be able to 
manage the lightning variation depending of the time of the day and the period
of the year.
Finally, this technology is controversial as it will allow its owner to track 
the people very easily.

== SCORE

4

== COMMENTS

The article gives not a lot of technical informations but was quite
honest about the limits that this technology encounters.
