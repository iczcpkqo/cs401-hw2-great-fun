== AGENT

Many different laboratories and companies (Oxford-based Exscientia, Healx,
Scipher Medicine...)

== GOAL

All of them are working on finding a cure for Covid-19 or new ways to test
patients more efficiently.

== DATA

They are using the current literature relating to diseases, the DNA and 
structure of the virus and the properties of different already known drugs.

== METHODS

Not mentioned 

== RESULTS

They already have make discovering regarding the virus (it could invade the
brain tissues and attack the reproductive system). They have identified 81 
potential drugs that could help. A Chinese company have announced an 
algorithm that can diagnose cases within 20 seconds.

== ISSUES

The experts warn that the AI may be trained with data about serious 
infections and would therefore be less efficient at detecting the early signs 
of the disease.
Also, it is hard to make pharmaceutical giants work with small laboratories
and share their data. 

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

It was interesting but I would have like to get more informations about the 
algorithms these companies are finding and how they manage to combine such
diverse data.
