== AGENT

MIT Media Lab

== GOAL

Show that the data that is used to train a machine learning algorithm can significantly influence its behavior. 

== DATA

Norman (the NN was named after the protagonist in Hitchcock's *Psycho*) was trained on image captions from extended exposure to dark areas of Reddit

== METHODS

Image Captioning in Deep Learning
- Generating a textual description of an image

Trained on gruesome and horrifying images and captions from Reddit

Norman was tested on Rorschach Inkblot tests, used to detect underlying thought disorders

== RESULTS

Norman's inkblot captions were compared against a similarly trained NN, whose image dataset was less disturbing (MSCOCO dataset)

Norman produced captions that were overwhelmingly disturbing and the majority of captions included death.

Inkblot 1
	- NormanAI: “a man is electrocuted and catches to death.”
	- StandardAI: “a group of birds sitting on top of a tree branch.”

Inkblot 2
	- NormanAI: “a man is shot dead.”
	- StandardAI: “a close up of a vase with flowers.”

Inkblot 3
	- NormanAI: “man jumps from floor window.”
	- StandardAI: “a couple of people standing next to each other.”
	
A subsequent project is ongoing that is set to prove that Norman can be retrained with enough human feedback.

Clearly incorrect training data can make an AI biased

== ISSUES

No issues, this project is to show that there are issues in other ML/AI projects
Ethically it could be said that exposing people to this AI could be mentally harmful, but there is a disclaimer in the project.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

I found this project very interesting, as it used Machine Learning to show that Machine Learning is imperfect, and that proper care must be taken when training it.
There is very little detailing how the Neural Network works, I could not find any research papers either.
