AGENT 

Jacob Buckman

GOAL 

Demonstrate a practical example of how to use Tensorflow in Python, and also discuss what Tensorflow is designed to work with.

DATA 

No previous data was used - the article is more of a demonstration of a method of Machine Learning.

METHODS 

They used Tensorflow, a method of Deep Learning used within Google to develop itâ€™s AI projects and products.

RESULTS 

With some intermediary coding skills, the agent was able to demonstrate how to use Tensorflow to achieve an organic neural networking ecosystem, which can be used in a practical ML scenario. 

COMMENTS 

While this is not an article explicitly on a specific use on a technology of Machine Learning, I would argue it is more important than this - it demonstrates what can be done with the technology using a framework such as Tensorflow.
