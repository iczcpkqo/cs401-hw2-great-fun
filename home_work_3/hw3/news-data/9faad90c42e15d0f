== AGENT
Fieldwork Robotics

== GOAL
To help alleviate growing shortage of human crop pickers.

== DATA
It works in a lab environment, where cauliflower heads are put in a long row, it is then guided by sensors and 3D cameras. 

== METHODS
Machine learning

== RESULTS
The robots are still being tested within greenhouses however can pick raspberries currently every 2.8 seconds compared to the humans average of 2 seconds. With the addition of 2 more arms the robots average will be brought down more.

== ISSUES
Issues I see is those who do still work in this sector could eventually be out competed by their robotic counterparts and be made redundant. Working outside could be more problematic to the robot due to weather conditions that would not be seen in a greenhouse. If this proves successful, the implementation of these robots could creep into other countries where this sector is still be worked by many people.

== SCORE
3

== COMMENTS
I can see the need for bolstering the workforce in areas in countries where there are not enough to work in that sector, but when the technology moves around the world and replaces full workforces that is when problems will begin for people. There is no mention of what method they used in the article to teach the robot.
