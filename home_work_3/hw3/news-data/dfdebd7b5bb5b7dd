Allen Institute for Cell Science

== GOAL

Identify Structures in Living Cells

== DATA

Images taken with bright field microscopy

== METHODS

Convolutional Neural Networks

== RESULTS

By the end they could acurately predict the location of structures in a human cell from images taken with brightfield microscopy.

== ISSUES

Issues occur when images are not clear, exposed to too much light or when a model trained on images from one microscope, it may not work with a training set from a different one.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

Good insight into the future of medicine with deep learning.
