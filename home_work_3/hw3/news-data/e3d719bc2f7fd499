== AGENT
Researchers from Tencent, along with other Chinese scientists
== GOAL
Using deep learning to predict critical COVID-19 cases.
== DATA
The use of classified patients data received over 3000 patients data, with permission
== METHODS
Constructed a three-layer feedforward neural network using the selected features for survival modeling. The output of the network is a single node, 
which predicts the risk score of developing critical illness. The deep learning network can learn from patients with covid and how well they recovered.
The likes of age, cancer history, x-ray abnormality, dyspnea are all taking into account.
== RESULTS
There is now an online tool for better risk monitoring for covid 19 patients. Their deep learning network had a very high accuracy for critical patients.
== ISSUES
No issues found, from my reading
== SCORE
5
== COMMENTS
It was interesting with alot of information on both covid related things, and their system
