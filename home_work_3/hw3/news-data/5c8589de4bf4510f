MIT researchers

== GOAL

Detect asymptomatic COVID-19 infections through cellphone-recorded coughs

== DATA

They established a website where people can record a series of coughs, through any web-enabled device
Along with the cough recording, participants also fill out a survey:
- COVID symptoms they are experiencing
- Whether or not they have COVID-19
- Whether they were diagnosed through
	- An official test
	- By a doctor’s assessment
	- Self-diagnosis
- Optional:
	- Gender
	- Geographical location
	- Native language

To date:
- ~70,000 recordings, each containing several forced coughs
	- Amounting to ~200,000 coughs
	- 2,500 of these recordings were from people that were COVID positive

### Dataset
All 2,500 COVID associated recordings
2,500 randomly-selected non-COVID associated recordings

#### Training/Test Data
Dataset split into:
- 4000 recordings for training
- 1000 recordings for testing 

== METHODS

3 Neural Networks based on a previous project to detect Alzheimer’s.

1. ResNet50
	- Residual Network, a type of Deep Convolutional Neural Network with 50 layers, where connections can skip layers. i.e. a neuron in Hidden Layer 3 can connect directly to Hidden Layer 6, skipping HL 4, 5
		- This speeds up training and allows more exploration of the feature space
	- To discriminate sounds associated with different degrees of vocal cord strength.

2. Type of NN not given.
	- In the Alzheimer’s project:
		-  "to distinguish emotional states evident in speech, because Alzheimer’s patients have been shown to display certain sentiments such as frustration, or having a flat affect, more frequently than they express happiness or calm"
	-  No specific information given for the COVID project

3. Type of NN not given
	- trained on the database of coughs in order to discern changes in lung and respiratory performance

Researchers combined all three models, and overlaid an algorithm to detect muscular degradation.
- Essentially an audio mask generating noise
	- Separates weak coughs from stronger coughs, which can be heard over the noise.

== RESULTS

98.5% of coughs from people confirmed with COVID-19 were identified correctly, and of those, it accurately detected all of the asymptomatic coughs.

== ISSUES

I do not see any ethical issues and am not familiar with the NN architecture to comment on technical problems

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

I found this very interesting, as the researchers found a link between two very different illnesses and used that similarity to quickly and easily tweak a NN from diagnosing Alzheimer's to diagnosing asymptomatic COVID-19
The use of three NNs is also interesting, rather than using one much larger NN.

Clearly the idea behind the COVID-19 NN is not a new idea, as it was very heavily based on the Alzheimer's NN, but the dataset used was created purely for this project, and seems to be unique
