GOAL
Using a 300-to-500-word description of a researcher’s problem, or the URL of an existing paper, the service returns a map of thousands of matching documents, visually grouped by topic.
DATA
This service uses the CORE collection, a searchable database of more than 134 million open-access papers, as well as journals to which the user’s library provides access.
METHODS
The tool blends three algorithms to create ‘document fingerprints’ that reflect word-usage frequencies, which are then used to rank papers according to relevance.
RESULTS
The result is a map of related papers.
COMMENTS
New papers are published worldwide at a rate of 1 million each year so this tool is useful to find similar papers.
