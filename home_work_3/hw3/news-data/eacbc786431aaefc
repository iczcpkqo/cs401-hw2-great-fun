== AGENT

Nasa

== GOAL

To detect creaters on mars

== DATA

6830 images from Nasa's Mars Reconaissance Orbiter

== METHODS

Supervised Learning

== RESULTS

The AI once trained was capable of detecting craters 480 times faster than a human.

== ISSUES

Requires significant computaional power, 750 copies of the classifier were being run simultaneously.
This is part of an ongoing issue where training and utilizing machine learning networks are having
significant contributions to carbon emissions.

"AI can't do the kind of skilled analysis a scientist can, but tools like this new algorithm can be thair assistants" 
- Kiri Wagstaff, JPL Computer Scientist -- Danger of it being used to replace skilled analysis which may work a significant proportion 
of the time, but is likely to miss things a human would not.
