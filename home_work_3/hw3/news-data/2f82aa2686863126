The big tech companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon generate particular data sets which would lend themselves to particular lines of insurance business 
such as home insurance and health.

== METHODS

Supervised learning & value-based dynamic pricing.

== RESULTS

It is proposal and not implemented yet by the insurance firms.

== ISSUES

It requires a large set of data from the big techicies such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon if they lend their hand. 
Even after that the damage is reported there can be dishonesty reporting the damages. 
The apprasing of the damages also would require a large training set because the damages are to be appraised automatically and legacy systems' data would not be able to define the depth of data required, 
so the already existing bulk data would require a lot of refinement.

== COMMENTS

The topic dealt in the press was quite intriguing as it can revolutionize the insurance industry.Though there are some firms of particular domains that have implemeted the same concept,
It would take a large amount of data, time and finances to get this implemented through out the insurance industry. There are areas where it can be be implemented fairly easily but there 
are several sectors that would face serious blockers while implementing the model and perfecting it. The model must also comply with regulations around consumer and data protections.
