== AGENT

University of Maryland

== GOAL

infer the direction of the thermodynamic arrow of time

== DATA

A set of simulated movies of physical processes with coreesponding labels indicating backwards and forwards

== METHODS

Supervised Learning to train a Neural Network

== RESULTS

They reported excellent accuracy

== ISSUES

How is saying excellent accuracy in any way meaningful to the reader. That isnt a result. The worst reporting of a story I have ever seen since Donald Trump became president

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

I think trying to infer physical phenomena is pretty neat. A really good use of the techonology. The use of an old method in logistic regression for something new is cool to see also.
