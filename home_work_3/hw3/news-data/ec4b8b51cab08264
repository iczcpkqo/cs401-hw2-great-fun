Brenden K. Petersen Et al.

GOAL

Characterizing a patient's progression through stages of sepsis, using a hidden Markov model to enable risk stratification and adaptive, personalized treatment. 

DATA

25,000 patients with suspected or confirmed infection, a subset of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California dataset

METHODS

Hidden Markov model with 5 different states(discharged, 3 states of severity and death). All model parameters were estimated. 

RESULTS

This study demonstrates the utility in using HMMs to provide insight into a patient's underlying physiological trajectory, which may be used to inform clinical decisions. 

COMMENTS

With more work it is possible that this study could predict sepsis trajectory to a higher accuracy than traditional means.
