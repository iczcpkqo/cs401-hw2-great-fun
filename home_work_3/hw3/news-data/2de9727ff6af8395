== GOAL
To beat the world champion Go player.
== DATA
AlphaGo was initially trained with a collection of over 30 million moves, played by expert players in historic games of Go. Once a good standard of play had been reached, it was further trained by having it compete against slightly altered instances of itself.
== METHODS
Reinforcement learning was used to train AlphaGo against instances of itself.
A combination of deep learning neural networks and tree search techniques were used. Monte Carlo tree search was used, guided by a “value network” and a “policy network”.
== RESULTS
AlphaGo beat the world champion, Lee Sedol 4 games to 1. 
== ISSUES
== SCORE
8
== COMMENTS
I thought this project was interesting. Unlike the DeepBlue machine, AlphaGo actually learned from experience. It was trained by studying real games of Go.
The press seemed to cover this story accurately.
