== GOAL



Using Spotify data to predict what song will be hits.



== DATA


Using a Spotify API 1.8 million songs data was collected, which include features such as song tempo, key, 
valence, energy, acousticness, dance ability, loudness,  etc.



== METHODS



Four different methods, logical regression, a neural network, a support vector machine (SVM) 
and a random forest (RF) architecture. Supervised.



== RESULTS



SVM architecture achieved the highest precision rate (99.53 percent), while the random forest model 
attained the best accuracy rate (88 percent) and recall rate (85.51 percent).



== ISSUES


The work is good I don't see any issues.

== SCORE

== COMMENTS



It's interesting to be able to predict trend by analyzing characteristics of a musical piece. 
The reporting of the research was good with multiple quotes from the researchers. 
Overall a interesting and fun project that was well reported.
