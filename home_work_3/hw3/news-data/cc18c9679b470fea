== ISSUES
· ethical issues:
To continuously improve the accuracy of this type of application, it needs to provide enough data and constantly let people train the machine. In the past, when we talked to others about this type of problem, I knew who the other person was and the emotion of the other person when chatting , And these are all private. However, although I am chatting with the machine now, it also means that there must be someone or a few people or even a team staring at me and chatting. I can’t know who the opposite person is. Are they angry because of my problem? Are they laughing at my question. In short, I am not comfortable.
