== AGENT

Google

== GOAL

To classify non-recorded audio in order to notify a user when there call is received by a human after being placed on hold.

== DATA

Conversation data collected by google utilising it's automated speech recognition technology.

== METHODS

Duplex is a recurrent neural network using reinforcement learning.

== RESULTS

So far it seems to be successful, the rollout will tell us more.

== ISSUES

This could clog up call centers even more as those manning the lines would have to wait for those with the AI to come back to their
phones to proceed.

There was some dispute in the beginning as to whether or not it would be necessary for the automated voice
to declare that it was not human. There could be a danger in similar technology becoming so accurate that it could correctly
mimic a persons voice to fabricate evidence or otherwise manipulate people who thought they were speaking to the person. 
Though this is not an issue with this specific iteration as it is a generalised voice and not specific to the user.

== SCORE

7

more info on how google duplex works.

I gave it a score of 7 for cool factor, because who likes to wait on hold? Also, convincing conversations from an AI is huge though that is more 
on google duplex's end than hold for me.
