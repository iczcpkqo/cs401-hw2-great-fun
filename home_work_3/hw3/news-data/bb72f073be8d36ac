== GOAL

To predict upcoming fashion trends in a hope to reduce the thousands of tonnes of clothes dumped every year and also to give retailers, with access to a machine learning insight, a compeditive advantage. 

== DATA

There are over 8 million data points collected each month from over 30 countries, from the social media feeds, emails and third party panels from the consumers and retailers in each of those countries.

== METHODS

The team used unsupervised learning to analyze the current trends and predict the outcomes for future product performance. 

== RESULTS

The results of this study are in the stats. Using machine learning to predict upcoming trends increases the success rates for new products by 30 to 80 percent. It also increases gross profit margins for these companies by 9 percent and improves speed to market by decreasing the product launch time by 30 percent. 

== ISSUES

I only wonder if after a certain amount of time this method of predicting trends will grow tiresome in the fashion industry. If the algorithm uses data already out there then it is only making suggestions based on ideas that already exists. This may grow boring to consumers over time as it seems to limit the creative possibility of fashion. 

== SCORE

5

== COMMENTS

I don't  have any expertise in fashion but I do think that this removes a level of creativity from the fashion industry. I would however be interested to see how different trends progress in different countries and would have liked if the article mentioned that.
