GOAL

Helping reporters analyze data and brainstorm story ideas.

DATA

FunnelAI uses natural language processing, a branch of machine learning, in order to connect businesses to their customers. Our advanced algorithms help companies and teams to maximize their uniquely human skills by providing them with the customers who have the intent to purchase their product.

METHODS

FunnelAI has a similar approach to using machine learning. Like Reuters, we leverage technology to allow companies to focus on their uniquely human capabilities. We empower our users to creatively use their marketing and sales resources to reach out to their customers in real time.

RESULTS

FunnelAI will help augment human capabilities by completing tasks and collecting data that improves productivity. 

COMMENTS
