== COMMENTS

This was an interesting article as the twitter had already tested their model for gender and racial biasing before the launch but still if the issues are surfacing it can be noted that
that there could have been unintentional errors while setting up clusters for the data set. The clusters could have been set so they favour more light skinned people and as the facial features
of a dark skinned person has a lower contrast could have caused this issue. The algorithm must be run on a  well amount of samples from all the ethinicity and gender.I think the facial recognition 
has not fully developed in as there have been cases of misjudged identity with even the popular african-american celebrities such as Michelle Obama, oprah ,serina williams etc.
