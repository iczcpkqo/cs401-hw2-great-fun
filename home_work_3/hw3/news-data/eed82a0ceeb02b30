GOAL

Given a grayscale photograph as input, this paper attempts to create a plausible color version of the photograph.

DATA

1.3M images from the ImageNet training set, validated on the first 10k images in the ImageNet validation set, and tested on a separate 10k images.

METHODS

Training a Convolutional Neural Network to map from a grayscale input to a distribution over quantizedcolor value outputs, using a technique for inferring point estimates of color from the predicted color distribution.

RESULTS

The results have shown that colorization with a deep CNN can come closer to producing results indistinguishable from real color photo.

COMMENTS

Although the results aren't always perfect, it is not always obvious from the photo that it was false color. The coloring of the photos appears real.
