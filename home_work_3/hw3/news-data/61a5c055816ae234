AGENT
The computers at GE which control the energy flow.

GOAL
Create a non-linear energy grid which allows the energy to flow in more of a network rather than a line.

DATA
100 years of data from using the same linear model for energy distribution.

METHODS
Machine learning and IoT.

RESULTS
Predictive maintenance and power optimisation from machine learning reduced "unplanned downtime by 5 percent" and "false positives by 75 percent" 
which is a massive improvement.

COMMENTS
I think all of these endeavours promise to be incredibly beneficial to the future of energy usage and GE as a company.
