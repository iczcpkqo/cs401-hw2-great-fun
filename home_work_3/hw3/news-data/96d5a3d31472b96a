Machine learning is an aspect of computer science that has been extended to multiple other applications of computer science. These fields include data science, engineering, and artificial intelligence. It emphasizes that machine learning thrives specifically in allowing machines to be better at pattern recognition. Through the use of pattern recognition many of the repetitive tasks that are done in a day to day process can be eliminated which will allow people to take on more intelligence dependent tasks.
