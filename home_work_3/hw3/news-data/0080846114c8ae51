== DATA

Observational data of the trajectory of Mars and the Sun as seen from Earth

== METHODS

RL

== RESULTS

Positioned the Sun as a center-piece of the solar system

== ISSUES

Human involvement is still needed to interpret the equations and how they relate to the movement of the planets around the Sun

8

== COMMENTS

Interesting to know that not only laws of physics, but other laws might be 'rediscovered' by means of ML
