GOAL

Develop DeepFace, software capable of recognizing when two pictures are of the same faces. This is called facial verification.

DATA

Labeled dataset containing 4 million pictures of around 4000 individuals. This was the largest facial dataset at the time.

METHODS

Used a neural network with 9 layers and 120 million parameters. Instead of standard convolution layers, DeepFace uses locally connected layers without weight sharing.

RESULTS

DeepFace was 97.25 percent accurate	on a dataset of faces called Labeled Faces in the Wild. This was an improvement over the previous facial verification and just short of the level of accuracy humans can produce.

COMMENTS

This method of facial recognition seems like an easy choice for a company that has access to such a large dataset of labeled pictures. I am interested in learning why they would choose to use locally connected layers instead of the standard way.
