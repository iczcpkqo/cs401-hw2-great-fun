The NOOA collects an overwhelming quantity of information. The goal is
to help increase the rate and quality of assimilating data. This could 
allow them to enhance meteorological prediction, including for violent 
events as tornadoes and hurricanes.

== DATA

All the data collected by the NOOA: satellite imagery, ground data, 
information coming from the Internet of things...

== METHODS

Not mentioned

== RESULTS

There is none wet but they hope to have all datasets available
for rapid dissemination and real-time processing in a common cloud framework
within 10 years.

== ISSUES

The team is trying to get as much support as it can from different 
organisations which demand lots of negotiations.

== SCORE

7
