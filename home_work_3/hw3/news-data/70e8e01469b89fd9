== AGENT

Google Health, in collaboration with DeepMind, Cancer Research UK Imperial Centre, Northwestern University, and Royal Surrey County Hospital

== GOAL

Develop an AI system which can identify cancer in breast screening mammograms with fewer false positives, and fewer false negatives than radiologists alone.

== DATA

Trained on anonymised mammograms from over 76,000 women in the UK and over 15,000 women in the US. Then tested on a seperate data set of more than 25,000 women in the UK and over 3,000 women in the US.

== METHODS

Supervised learning on training set. The system consists of three independent deep learning models, each of which produces a
cancer risk score between 0 and 1 for the entire mammography case. The final prediction of the
system was the mean of the predictions from the three independent models.

== RESULTS

On the UK data set, the AI system produced a 1.2% reduction in false positives, and 2.7% reduction of false negatives. On the US set, it produced a 5.7% reduction in false positives and 9.4% reduction of false negatives.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

The RTÃ‰ report was very bare and lacking in specific information, particularly with regard to the method.
