Goal: Use deep learning to improve the facial graphics in the game FIFA 18

Data: data is gathered by recording in game footage and a load of images from Google of the players.

Method: Using different model architechture and different deep learning algorithms.

Results: There is a clear inprovement in the faces of the players that are used. It is even possble to self insert your own face into the game.

Comments: As the author mentions that he himself has little graphical experiance I wonder along with him why it isn't feasable for game developers to use a deep learning method to improve at the very least facial graphics in games if not the entire graphical world.
