MIT

==GOAL

To identify potential new TB drugs.

==DATA

72 small molecules and their interactions with more than 400 protein kinases from ZINC database

==METHODS

Gaussian Model, assign uncertainty values to data. Supervised Learning.

==RESULTS

90% of predictions by model were found to inhibit bacterial growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 

==ISSUES

When using the same dataset on supervised learning algorithm, did not yield any useful results.

==SCORE

==COMMENTS

I think it's pretty cool would like to hear results of inhibitors on patients.

==GOAL

Create smart gloves that can guide employees by hand through tasks.

==DATA

Sensor data from Hitseed smart textiles.

==METHODS


Deep learning, gesture based algorithms in an embedded system in the gloves and glasses. Convolutional Neural Network.
Information transferred across bluetooth low energy network.

==RESULTS

Sensor data that can be used for motion improvements in physiotherapy, detecting machines running based on vibration or sound spectrum.

==COMMENTS

Set of potential applications is very far-reaching. I'm glad they recieved EUR 100,000 seed funding from EU Horizon 2020 ATTRACT project.

University of Valencia, Pompeu Fabra University

== GOAL

Analyze the phenomenon of visual illusions in convolutional networks compared to their effect on the vision of human beings.

== DATA



== METHODS

Trained CNN for simple tasks such as removing noise or blur. Tested on sounds or images that include some kind of illusion.

== RESULTS

Networks are also susceptible to perceiving reality in a biased way, caused by visual illusions of brightness and color.
Visual illusions that occur in the CNN do not necessarily have to coincide with the biological illusory perceptions.
There can be different illusions seen by NN that are foreign to the human brain.

== ISSUES

Very little detail in the neural network istself. Very little detail in the illusions.

Pretty cool article, not enough detail.

== AGENT

University of Cambridge

== GOAL

Reduce communication gap for non-verbal people with motor disabilities who rely on computers to converse.

== DATA

Users Location, Time of Day, Users speaking partner identified with front mounted camera.

== METHODS

Information Retrieval Algorithms using time of day, location. Speaking partner identified with computer vision algortithm.
Context tags added to the words the user types to form a query.

== RESULTS

Developed a context-aware method that reduces the communication gap by eliminating between 50%-96% of keystrokes
the person has to type to communicate by allowing a user to quickly retrieve sentences they have typed in the past.

== ISSUES

Says that analysis helped researchers to understand the best method for retrieving sentences and the impact of a range of
sentences but doesn't say how

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS
Think this will be very useful for many people without any extra effort from users. I would have liked if it talked a bit
more about the analysis phase of words and the impact of this.
