== AGENT
USC Viterbi Engineering researchers
== GOAL
Their research paper is, "There Is Hope After All: Quantifying Opinion and Trustworthiness in Neural Networks". Their goal is to make AI trustworthy
== DATA
The system is a tool where you can input lots of different types of data. One test case was the 2016 presidential election. Self driving cars are a
key piece of data for their tool.
== METHODS
Employing what is known as subjective logic to assess the architecture of the neural networks. Subjective logic is suitable for modeling and analysing
situations involving uncertainty and relatively unreliable sources. Their tool DeepTrust can quantify the amount of uncertainty.
== RESULTS
This model is the first of its kind but it has the potential to make "artificial intelligence aware and adaptive."
== ISSUES
Allowing AI to be more aware may not be in the best interest  of many.
== SCORE
8
== COMMENTS
It was interesting with alot of information on the DeepTrust system.
