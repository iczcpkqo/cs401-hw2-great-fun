== AGENT

Ben Hamm, an employee at Amazon

== GOAL

To punish his cat Metric for killing small animals by locking it out of the house

== DATA

over 23,000 photos, hand sorted to determine whether the cat was in view, whether it was coming or going and if it was carrying prey.

== METHODS

Supervised learning on the test set. The algorithm was then connected to a camera and controlled a cat flap, which would lock for 15 minutes if it determined that the cat was carrying prey.

== RESULTS

Over a period of 5 weeks, the cat was unfairly locked out once, and was able to gain entry once out of the seven times it had caught something.

== ISSUES



== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

This is just a fun one I wanted to include.
