== AGENT

== GOAL

To predict the 2018 world cup winner

== DATA

Previous world cup events

== METHODS

Neural Network

== RESULTS

They predicted Brazil even though France won.

== ISSUES

Football is far to unpredictable.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

I think if they incorporated individual players involved and current skill level they would get a more accurate prediction, but ultimately still a low chance of a correct prediction due to random factors unknown before the tournament.
