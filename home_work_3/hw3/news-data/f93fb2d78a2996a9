Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)

== GOAL

To find new antibiotics

== DATA

Initially Atomic and Molecular features of 2500 drugs and natural compounds. Then library of 6000 molecules and following more than 107 million molecules from ZINC15 database. 

== METHODS

Reinforcement learning

== RESULTS

They were able to discover a molecule that displayed bactericidal activity against a wide phylogenetic spectrum of pathogens.

== ISSUES

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

These algorithms are of great help to discover new antibiotics that scientist did not even think of. It speeds up the researches and helps scientist to explore into dimensions that were never touched.

North-western University in Illinois and Google

== GOAL

To boost the effectiveness for Lung Cancer screening

== DATA

Training data - 42290 CT lung scans for nearly 15000 patients

== METHODS

Unsupervised learning. 

== RESULTS

Boosted cancer detection by 5% and cutting false positives by 11%

== ISSUES

== COMMENTS

It is great use of technology to detect the disease at initial stages so that it is easy to treat and less number of people have to go through the pain.

University of Helsinki

== GOAL

To predict human thoughts by creating images of the same.

== DATA

31 volunteers participated to react on AI- generated images of diverse looking people.
The subjects were asked to concentrate on certain features, such as faces that looked old or were smiling. While looking at a rapidly presented series of face images, the EEGs of the subjects were fed to a neural network, which inferred whether any image was detected by the brain as matching what the subjects were looking for.

== METHODS

Supervised learning

== RESULTS

The neural network adapted based on ECGs that were fed to them by the volunteers. Then images were created by computer after training nearly matched with the features what participants were thinking of. There was an accuracy of 83%.

== ISSUES

The algorithm does not recognises the thoughts of the person rather just responds to different mental categories. They were not able to find out the specific old person that person was thinking of. It was just associated with the old age.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

It is quite fascinating how machine leaning algorithms have improved reading human thinking. There is still a lot more to go and explore.

== GOAL

To decipher lost languages.

== DATA

== METHODS

Unsupervised learning

== RESULTS

The algorithm can segment words in ancient language and map them to counterparts in a related language. It enables to capture pertinent patterns of language change and express them as computational constraints. It was able to decipher dead language of Ugaritic and Linear B, which took decades for humans to decode.
